/**
 * Grades `supabase/functions/_shared/token-pricing.ts` — the one home for LLM token pricing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The meter (`meter_llm_usage`) carries a cost figure into a usage record, and a
 * usage record is the thing a billing decision is eventually made from. Three properties therefore
 * have to be true and have to STAY true, and none of them is visible by reading the table:
 *
 *   1. No PRE-EXISTING provider/model pairing changed price when per-model pricing was introduced.
 *      The §33 visual-critique cost cap routes frontier on `claude-sonnet-5` and compares a running
 *      spend against `STUDIO_CRITIQUE_COST_CAP_USD`; if sonnet's rate moved, that cap silently
 *      allows more or fewer iterations. Section 1 pins every previously-priced pairing to its exact
 *      previous arithmetic.
 *   2. An unpriceable call returns `undefined`, never `0`. Zero and unknown are different facts —
 *      and `COALESCE(cost, 0)` downstream turns the second into the first for free.
 *   3. Haiku is no longer booked at reasoning-tier rates. This was the live defect: 8,535,448 haiku
 *      tokens on production would have been priced at roughly 3× their list price.
 *
 * It runs the REAL module — Node executes the same source Deno type-checks, which is the reason
 * `token-pricing.ts` deliberately carries no imports. No re-implementation of the arithmetic lives
 * here; a test that recomputes the thing it is grading proves only that it can multiply.
