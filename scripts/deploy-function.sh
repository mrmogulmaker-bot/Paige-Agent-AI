# Deploy a Supabase edge function via the Management API (Lovable-free, CLI-free).
#
# Why this exists: the Supabase CLI's HTTP client bypasses this environment's
# egress proxy (TransportError), and Lovable was removed from the deploy path.
# curl honors the proxy and reads files straight from disk (exact bytes), so this
# is the reliable way to ship an edge function — including large multi-file ones.
#
# Usage:  SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_xxx ./scripts/deploy-function.sh <function-slug> [--no-verify-jwt]
# Example: SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_xxx ./scripts/deploy-function.sh paige-ai-chat
#
# It auto-discovers the function's transitive local (_shared) dependencies from
# its index.ts imports and uploads them all with correct relative paths.
