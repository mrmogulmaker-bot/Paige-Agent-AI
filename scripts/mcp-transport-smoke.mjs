/**
 * The hardened outbound transport — driven, not described.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Four copies of the SSRF validator shipped, and every one of them was missing the same
 * three protections: credentials in the URL, a bounded wait, a bounded body. Prose in a
 * header comment is what let that happen four times. So this runs the REAL
 * `_shared/ssrfGuard.ts` and `_shared/mcp-client.ts` against a REAL HTTP server and
 * asserts on what they actually do.
 *
 * WHAT IS SUBSTITUTED, AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 *   - `Deno.resolveDns` is shimmed, because this runs under Node. The shim returns the
 *     addresses each case is about; the numeric validation being tested is the shipped
 *     code, untouched.
 *   - Address translation is shimmed: the guard sees the real hostname and runs in full,
 *     and only afterwards is the connection pointed at the local server. Everything the
 *     transport cases are about — redirect status, byte counting, the abort, the SSE
 *     framing — happens against a genuine server over a genuine socket.
 *
 * Nothing else is stubbed. The guard, the client, the JSON-RPC handling and the error
 * mapping are the shipped code.
