/**
 * one-approval-gate-lint — there is ONE way to prove the operator said yes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A STYLE RULE. Paige can delete a contact, grant a role,
 * buy a number, publish a page. Before any of those run, the handler requires evidence that the
 * operator approved THAT call. The evidence is a fingerprint the server computed and the Approve
 * button echoed back in the request BODY — a place a model cannot write to.
 *
 * Between 2026-08-31 and 2026-09-01, three separate slices independently built a SECOND way to
 * prove the same thing (#709, #711, #718). Each was competent. That is exactly what makes the
 * pattern dangerous: a door with three locks is only as strong as the weakest one, and nobody
 * inspects the weak lock because each looks correct on its own. Two of the three accepted
 * evidence a model can manufacture — a token echoed back through a tool result, and a comparison
 * of the operator's last message against the exact words "Approved — run it."
 *
 * So this guard does not forbid gated actions. It forbids a SECOND CHANNEL. A new action that
 * needs approval gets it for free from the existing gate; what it must not do is invent its own
 * way to say yes.
 *
 * HOW TO ADD A GATED ACTION — the whole contract, so nobody has to reverse-engineer it:
 *   1. Classify the tool in `_shared/action-risk.ts` (ordinary | high | owner_only). The gate
 *      reads that file and nothing else, and an unclassified write refuses to run.
 *   2. Stop. Approval is already handled. Do not add a request field, do not read the operator's
 *      prose, do not echo a token back from a tool result.
 *   3. If — and only if — the action needs the operator to have SEEN a specific consequence
 *      first (an archive that destroys a folder's contents, say), mint a preview binding row and
 *      require it as a PRECONDITION: single-use, expiring, scoped to this tenant and this
 *      requester, and created BEFORE the current turn. That is a different claim from "they said
 *      yes", which is why it is allowed to coexist. `pipeline_archive_preview` is the worked
 *      example.
 *
 * Full contract: docs/doctrine/one-approval-gate.md
