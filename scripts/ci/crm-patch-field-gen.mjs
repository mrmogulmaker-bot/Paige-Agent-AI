/**
 * crm-patch-field-gen — the patch field list the model sees is DERIVED from the database, and
 * drift between the two turns CI red.
 *
 * ── THE INCIDENT THIS EXISTS FOR (production, 2026-09-25) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The owner asked Paige, in live Solo chat, to add a contact — John Coleman, at a heating and
 * cooling company, with a Chicago street address. He pressed Approve. The approval was claimed
 * correctly: `paige_pending_confirmations.consumed = true`, and `paige_audit_log` recorded
 * `crm.governed_decision -> execute` on lane `confirm`. The approval gate did its job.
 *
 * Then the executor threw, at 17:37:52.303Z:
 *
 *     CRM_PATCH_FIELDS_INVALID:company_name,zip
 *
 * Paige had sent `company_name` and `zip`. The database accepts `entity_name` and `zip_code`.
 *
 * She had NO WAY TO KNOW. The tool definition described `patch` as, in full:
 *
 *     patch: { type: "object", description: "Only fields the operator asked to change." }
 *
 * A bare object. No field list, no names, no closed set — so the model filled it with the words a
 * human would use. `company_name` is what a person calls the company name. `zip` is what a person
 * calls the zip code. Both are wrong, and nothing in the schema said so.
 *
 * ── WHY A TRANSLATION MAP WAS REJECTED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious fix is a two-field rename: map `company_name -> entity_name`, `zip -> zip_code`. It
 * works today and fails on the next field a user names in plain English — `mobile`, `company`,
 * `postcode`, `notes` on an update. The ruling rejected it for exactly that reason. The field list
 * presented to the model must ORIGINATE from the database allowlist, so that a field added, removed
 * or renamed in the database cannot leave the schema quietly stale.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE ALLOWLISTS ACTUALLY LIVE (verified against prod, not assumed) ──────────────────────
 *
 * `public.execute_crm_command` — the name you would reach for first — contains ZERO allowlist
 * sites. The live authority is two other functions. Verified by asking prod which functions can
 * even raise the error:
 *
 *     select n.nspname, p.proname from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
 *      where n.nspname = 'public'
 *        and pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) like '%CRM_PATCH_FIELDS_INVALID%';
 *
 *     -> public.execute_crm_command_reversible   (6 allowlist sites)
 *        public.preview_crm_command              (1 allowlist site)
 *
 * Exactly two functions in the entire database, and seven allowlists between them. That query is
 * the completeness proof: there is no third site to miss.
 *
 * ── THE SEVEN ARE NOT ONE LIST, AND THAT IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `contact.create` allows `notes`. `contact.update` allows `current_notes` — the same concept under
 * a different name, because the create path writes a seed note and the update path edits the live
 * one. `task.create` accepts nine fields including `assignee_user_id` and `due_date`; `task.update`
 * accepts four and NEITHER of those. Collapsing the seven into one shared list would hand the model
 * a field the database will reject on four of the seven actions — reintroducing the incident with
 * different field names. Each action therefore gets its own derived set.
 *
 * ── WHY A COMMITTED ARTIFACT AND NOT A RUNTIME READ ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stated plainly, because a materialised copy that nobody admits to is the thing the ruling warns
 * about: THIS GUARD MATERIALISES THE DATABASE'S LISTS INTO A COMMITTED TYPESCRIPT FILE. It is not a
 * hand-typed list — it is machine-derived and machine-checked — but it is a copy, and the honest
 * description of it is a copy with a tripwire.
 *
 * The tripwire is the entire reason it is allowed. The alternative, reading the allowlists from the
 * database when the tool definition is built, puts a query on the path of every Chat turn: a cold
 * start or a transient database error would then produce a turn with NO CRM TOOLS AT ALL, or worse,
 * tools with an empty field set that refuses every legitimate patch. The tool definition must not
 * be able to fail. So the read happens at build time, the result is committed, and this guard makes
 * the copy unable to drift in silence — which is the property the ruling actually demands.
 *
 * ── HOW DRIFT IS MADE LOUD — TWO HALVES, AND THE SECOND IS NOT OPTIONAL ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Default mode re-derives the seven lists from the migration SQL that DEFINES these functions and
 * diffs them against the committed artifact. Any difference — a field added, removed, renamed, or
 * an action's list reordered — exits non-zero and prints the exact delta. No secrets, no network,
 * so it runs on every PR including from forks.
 *
 * That half reads migration TEXT, which means this file re-implements the resolution rule Postgres
 * already owns, and the "NEWEST DECLARATION WINS" note below is exactly that re-implementation. So
 * `--write` also emits a pgTAP twin, `supabase/tests/crm_patch_fields_match_database.sql`, which
 * asserts the same seven lists against a REAL DATABASE through `pg_get_functiondef()` — the
 * database `supabase db reset` builds by replaying the whole chain, in the `paige-spine-contract`
 * database-contract job. There, PostgreSQL decides which definition is live and the text-slicing
 * below is not on the trusted path at all. If the two ever resolve differently, they disagree and
 * the build goes red. Both artifacts are written in one pass and both are diffed here, so neither
 * can be hand-edited into agreement with the other.
 *
 * It also asserts the allowlist COUNT per function (6 and 1). A new allowlist appearing in either
 * function fails the guard even though every existing list still matches — otherwise an eighth
 * patch-bearing action could be added and silently never reach the schema.
 *
 * NEWEST DECLARATION WINS. These are `create or replace function` bodies, so prod runs whichever
 * migration sorts LAST by filename, and an earlier-sorting file that merges later is shadowed the
 * instant it lands. `scripts/ci/tool-catalogue-lint.mjs` documents that exact failure happening
 * five times on `list_tool_autonomy`, once erasing 25 rows. So the extractor walks every migration
 * in filename order and keeps the LAST definition of each function, never the first it finds.
 *
 * ── LIVE PARITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The migration chain is the definition site, but prod can in principle be changed out of band (a
 * hand-applied MCP statement, a hotfix). Point this at a dump of the live definitions to prove the
 * repo and prod still agree:
 *
 *     CRM_PATCH_LIVE_DEFS=/path/to/defs.json node scripts/ci/crm-patch-field-gen.mjs
 *
 * where defs.json is [{ "proname": "...", "def": "<pg_get_functiondef output>" }, ...].
 *
 * VERIFIED AGAINST PRODUCTION 2026-09-26, and worth stating precisely because the brief warned
 * that `20270204000000` is superseded and must not be trusted as the source of truth. It is not
 * trusted: prod was asked directly. `pg_get_functiondef` on ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu` returns
 * exactly two functions containing CRM_PATCH_FIELDS_INVALID, carrying 6 and 1 allowlists, and all
 * seven live lists are field-for-field identical to what this script derives — including the
 * `notes` / `current_notes` split. The ten generated pgTAP assertions were additionally executed
 * against prod as plain SQL and all ten returned true, so the emitted proof is known to RUN and
 * not merely to have been written. Negative controls run at the same time: reinstating
 * `company_name`/`zip` in the expected list, and asserting contact.update's list against
 * contact.create's allowlist, both returned false.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `task.assign`, `task.reschedule` and `activity.log` also take a `patch`, and have NO allowlist.
 * They read specific keys (`assignee_user_id`; `due_date`; `channel`/`subject`/`body`) and ignore
 * anything else, so the database cannot raise CRM_PATCH_FIELDS_INVALID for them. Closing their
 * schema would INVENT a constraint prod does not enforce — replacing the database as authority
 * instead of agreeing with it. They keep the open `{ type: "object" }` patch. If an allowlist is
 * ever added to one, the per-function count assertion above fails and this comment is what tells
 * the next person why.
