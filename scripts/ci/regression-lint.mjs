/**
 * regression-lint — catch the doctrine-regression classes a type checker never will, on the
 * lines a PR actually ADDED (never whole files, never the whole tree).
 *
 * Added-lines-only is the honest, correct scope. `main` still carries pre-existing violations
 * (the live `index.html` meta description ships "AI-powered"; older edge-function copy; immutable
 * past migrations with permissive `USING (false)`) — those are owned by dedicated cleanup lanes
 * (§2 amputation / §3 copy sweep, Lane E). A whole-tree or whole-changed-file gate would either be
 * red on day one (ignored) or block an unrelated edit to a file that happens to carry old debt.
 * By scanning only the `+` lines of the diff, this gate's job is exactly "don't ADD a violation" —
 * which makes the acceptance test true ("a PR that adds a banned phrase to a shipped file fails")
 * across ALL shipped surfaces, not just src/.
 *
 * Coverage (the shipped surfaces a §3/jargon regression can reach):
 *   - src — ts,tsx,js,jsx,css,html
 *   - index.html — the meta/OG description every crawler + LLM reads (Lane E flags it)
 *   - public — llms.txt, static assets
 *   - supabase/functions — .ts edge functions compose user-facing email/copy
 * Migration policy check: supabase/migrations .sql files.
 *
 * Checks (on ADDED lines only):
 *   1. §3 banned marketing phrases + "MMA OS" operator jargon in a shipped surface.
 *   2. a new `USING (false)` / `WITH CHECK (false)` policy line not declared restrictive
 *      (a permissive deny is decorative — permissive policies OR together).
 *
 * Escape hatch (§13, for a justified mention — e.g. a comment that quotes the ban): put
 * `ci-allow-regression` on the added line.
 *
 * Diff range: `git diff $BASE_REF $HEAD_REF` (defaults origin/main…HEAD) — the SAME two-endpoint
 * form ci.yml's changed-files step uses, so the two gates never disagree about the change set.
