/**
 * Two migration files may never share a version, and a migration this branch adds may never reuse
 * a version that already exists on the base branch.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` is keyed on the VERSION alone. When a
 * version is already recorded, `supabase db push` does not fail and does not warn — it SKIPS the
 * file. So a colliding migration merges, CI stays green, the `db-live` tag advances, every badge
 * reads healthy, and the migration simply never exists on production. The objects it was supposed
 * to create are absent, and the first sign of it is whatever breaks weeks later.
 *
 * MEASURED, 2026-09-01. Merging main into a long-lived branch produced THREE collisions at once:
 *
 *   20261018000000  chat_turn_append_tenant_scope           vs main's secret_read_keeps_its_approvals
 *   20261019000000  credit_extraction_review_state          vs main's solo_setup_business_brief
 *   20261020000000  tool_autonomy_catalogue_covers_the_gate vs prod's primary_number_is_always_active
 *
 * The Supabase preview reported ONE of them — it stops at the first duplicate-key error — so
 * fixing what it named would have left two behind and looked resolved. The third had no duplicate
 * FILENAME anywhere in the repository (its twin exists only in production's ledger, applied from
 * a branch that is not merged), so scanning the tree for repeated prefixes cannot find it either.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD DOES AND DOES NOT COVER. It runs offline against git, so it catches the two
 * shapes that are decidable without a database:
 *   1. two files in the tree sharing a version — always wrong, whoever wrote them;
 *   2. a version this branch ADDS that already exists on the merge base — the merge-collision
 *      shape, which is the common one on a long-lived branch.
 * It does NOT and cannot catch shape 3: a version recorded in production whose file is not in this
 * repository at all. That needs the live ledger, which CI has no credentials for. Stated plainly
 * rather than implied, because a guard trusted for more than it checks is worse than none — the
 * pre-merge check for that shape is a query against `schema_migrations`, and it belongs in the
 * §32.a persisted-apply confirmation, not here.
 *
 * The fix is always to RENAME the new migration to a free, later version — never to renumber the
 * one already applied, which would orphan a live row.
