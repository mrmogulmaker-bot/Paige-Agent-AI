/**
 * Every `WRITE_TARGET` value must name a table this repository actually creates, or be declared a
 * deliberate non-table label.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. `WRITE_TARGET` supplies the `target_type` on the attribution row written for each
 * mutating tool — the record a write landed on, so a person tracing "what did Paige change" reaches
 * something real. It is the readable half of the audit trail: the id says WHICH row, this says
 * which KIND of row, and a wrong value makes the pair unresolvable.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Four values named tables that have never existed anywhere — `activities`,
 * `calendar_events`, `content`, `event_kinds` — so the attribution rows for SEVEN tools pointed at
 * nothing. Found by grounding the map against production, not by any gate.
 *
 * THE GATE THAT COULD NOT SEE IT. The harness already asserted that a rail event NAMES the record
 * it changed, and that every executable mutation names an entity. A wrong name satisfies both
 * perfectly. Presence and truth are different properties: the first needs only a non-empty string,
 * the second needs a schema. That is the gap this closes, and it is why the fix is a lint rather
 * than another harness check.
 *
 * HOW IT DECIDES, and what it cannot decide. A value is accepted when some migration in this repo
 * has a `CREATE TABLE` for it, or when it appears in NON_TABLE_LABELS below with a reason. It
 * cannot ask production — CI has no credentials — so a table that exists live but is created by no
 * migration here would be reported as missing. That direction is the safe one: it complains about a
 * value it cannot verify rather than passing one it cannot check. If that case ever arises, add the
 * migration rather than an exemption; a target with no migration is a separate problem.
