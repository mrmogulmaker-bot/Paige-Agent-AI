/**
 * tool-catalogue-lint — every tool the runtime GOVERNS must be one the operator can SEE.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS GUARDS, measured 2026-08-24. `paige-ai-chat`'s `MUTATING_TOOLS` is the runtime
 * autonomy gate: 46 tools that write, create or change state, each defaulting to `confirm` so
 * Paige proposes before she acts. `list_tool_autonomy()` is the catalogue the operator's
 * Capabilities surface renders — and it carries 23. **The other 23 are governed and invisible.**
 * They cannot be flipped to autopilot, and — the half that matters — they cannot be turned OFF.
 * Among them: `n8n_delete_workflow` (permanent, by its own description), `marketplace_install`,
 * `forge_subagent`, `update_business_profile`, and the whole `plan_*` family.
 *
 * It is drift, not a decision. The Studio migration says so in its own header: it re-declared the
 * catalogue "from a copy" and the copy predated those tools. CD saw a slice of it and wrote
 * "Four automation tools are gated at runtime but missing"; the task ledger recorded five. The
 * real number is 23, which is what happens to a hand-maintained list that has no check.
 *
 * SO THIS IS A RATCHET, NOT A WALL. Failing outright would block every unrelated PR on a
 * pre-existing gap, so the known 23 are the baseline: the guard fails when the gap GROWS — a new
 * governed tool added with no catalogue row — and tells you to lower the baseline when it
 * shrinks. Same shape as `scripts/ci/tsc-ratchet.mjs`, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── TWO MORE HOLES, CLOSED 2026-09-24 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE STALE COPY. `list_tool_autonomy` is CREATE OR REPLACEd with its WHOLE body, so the newest
 * declaration by filename is the only one prod runs. Two lanes each write a migration from a copy
 * of the catalogue, and whichever sorts later silently erases the other's rows. Each PR is
 * internally consistent and passes alone. This is not hypothetical and it is not rare — the chain
 * carries FIVE removal events, and the largest is 25 rows:
 *
 *   PR #1237 landed 20270305000000 at 12:45 on 2026-09-13, written from a pre-CRM copy.
 *   PR #1252 landed 20270316000000 at 17:16, from the same copy.
 *   PR #1234 landed 20270204000000 at 23:50 — adding 25 governed CRM rows at a version that sorts
 *   BEFORE both. Its rows were shadowed the instant it merged, so the same PR had to ship
 *   20270318000000 to put them back. That migration's own header records it: the earlier body
 *   "hides 23 source-backed CRM controls plus two already-classified paid credit-pull controls."
 *
 * A human caught that one by hand. Note where the new file sorted — EARLIER than the tip — so a
 * "compare the newest declaration against the one before it" check would have seen +25/-0 and
 * passed. The removal is only visible by walking EVERY consecutive pair in the chain, which is
 * what `shadowedRemovals` does. It is also genuinely pre-merge: a PR branch carries the other
 * lane's already-merged migration, so the shadowing is present in the tree CI tests.
 *
 * A removal is legitimate sometimes. It has to be SAID: a `-- catalogue-removal-ok: <key> — <why>`
 * line in the migration that drops it. History predates the rule, so the 42 existing removals are
 * baselined by exact (migration, key) pair in `tool-catalogue-shadow-baseline.json` — never a
 * count, for the reason stated just below.
 *
 * THE OTHER DIRECTION. The guard graded `runtime \ catalogue` and nothing else, so a dropped row
 * for a tool that is NOT runtime-governed vanished silently. That blind spot is closed above: the
 * chain check compares KEY SETS and does not care whether a key is governed. What the guard does
 * NOT do is demand that non-mutating tools be catalogued — see `phantomRows` for why.

 *                        asserts action-risk.ts must NOT list it; :77 asserts the Chat tool is gone.
 *                        The catalogue row outlived both.
 *   pipeline_create      "phantom/unclassified tools" in src/solo/data/capabilityTools.ts:171,
 *   pipeline_add_stage   listed in UNMAPPED_CATALOGUE_TOOLS so no Solo knob renders for them.
