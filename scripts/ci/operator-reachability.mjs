/**
 * BUILD-ORDER Layer 1's done-check, as a guard rather than a habit.
 *
 * CD's bar: *"`git grep` from `OperatorEntry` reaches every file under `surfaces/`. A file no
 * live path imports is not shipped, whatever its tests say."* That is exactly the failure the
 * main audit found — ~370 KB of correct porting reachable from nothing, pinned only by its own
 * tests, which is why a green suite proved nothing about it.
 *
 * So this walks the real import graph from the operator entry point and fails when a surface,
 * or any module under `src/operator/`, is orphaned. A test that renders a component is not the
 * console rendering it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a TypeScript-aware resolver: a regex over `import`/`export …  from` and
 * `import()` is enough for this codebase's conventions (`@/` alias or a relative path), and a
 * resolver that silently fails open would defeat the point. An unresolvable specifier is
 * reported rather than skipped.
