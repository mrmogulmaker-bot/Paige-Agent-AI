/**
 * capability-declaration-lint — every tool the MODEL can call must be DECLARED by a domain,
 * and where two sources describe the same act they must not contradict each other.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS GUARDS, measured 2026-09-24 against this tree. Capability truth is kept in five
 * places that do not know about one another: the Chat handler's tool array (what the model sees),
 * the PAIGE Spine registry (what a domain declares), `list_tool_autonomy()` (what the operator can
 * switch), `_shared/action-risk.ts` (how much proof an act needs), and the Capability Kit bypass
 * ledger. `lint:tool-catalogue` already holds the runtime↔operator seam. THIS guard holds the
 * model↔Spine seam, which nothing held before:
 *
 *   154 tools on the maximum model surface · 65 of them declared by a Spine capability ·
 *    89 undeclared, of which 46 MUTATE.
 *
 * Those 46 are the ones that matter. An undeclared READ tool is a documentation gap. An undeclared
 * MUTATING tool is an act with no domain owner, no idempotency statement, no approval-authority
 * declaration and no Rail contract — and the autonomy policy will happily run it unattended once a
 * tenant sets it to `auto`. `document_generate` is the live example: it mints offer letters with
 * signature lines and an "Accept" CTA, is classified `ordinary`, has ZERO Spine registration and
 * ZERO `record_capability_run` coverage. That is why rule 3 exists — the two populations are
 * reported separately, because they are not the same problem.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES
 *
 *   1. DECLARATION. Every tool on the model surface has a Spine capability whose `action.chatTool`
 *      names it, or it is an EXACT entry in the shrink-only baseline. New tool, no declaration,
 *      not in the baseline → FAIL.
 *   2. AGREEMENT. Where a tool has BOTH a Spine capability and an action-risk class, the two must
 *      agree. The rules below are derived from the real types — `SpineActionClassification`,
 *      `SpineRiskPolicy` and `ActionRisk` — and nothing else. This rule is a WALL, not a ratchet:
 *      it has zero violations on this tree, so enforcing it blocks nothing that is already true.
 *   3. SEVERITY. A baselined MUTATING tool is reported distinctly from a baselined READ tool, and
 *      a baselined READ tool that later GAINS a risk class fails — the membership stayed flat but
 *      the gap got worse, which is exactly the churn a bare count hides.
 *
 * A RATCHET, NOT A WALL (rule 1). Failing outright would block every unrelated PR on a
 * pre-existing gap, so the known 89 are the baseline: the guard fails when the gap GROWS and tells
 * you to lower the baseline when it shrinks. Same posture, and deliberately the same wording, as
 * `scripts/ci/tool-catalogue-lint.mjs`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT COVER, stated so nobody reads silence as coverage (§13):
 *   · A Spine capability that declares a `chatTool` NO tool array contains — today exactly one,
 *     `integrations_health` (paige-spine/domains/integrations_surface.ts). The registry asserts a
 *     Chat binding for a tool that does not exist. That is the mirror seam and it wants its own
 *     check; this one walks the model surface, not the registry.
 *   · Catalogue rows with no tool behind them, receipts, and Kit adoption. Other guards, or gaps.
 *
 *   node scripts/ci/capability-declaration-lint.mjs
 *   node scripts/ci/capability-declaration-lint.mjs --self-test
 *   node scripts/ci/capability-declaration-lint.mjs --update-baseline   (regenerate, deliberately)
