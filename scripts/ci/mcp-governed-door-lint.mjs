/**
 * mcp-governed-door-lint — the no-bypass guard for the inbound MCP door.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY A TEST CANNOT.
 * `paige-mcp` registers its tools as 119 separate top-level `mcp.tool("<name>", …)` calls. Nothing
 * about that shape forces a new tool to be governed: a developer adds a 120th call, it dispatches,
 * and no test fails — because a test can only exercise the tools it knows about. The gap is
 * structural, so the guard has to be structural too.
 *
 * The rules below are deliberately mechanical. Each one failed to be true at some point in this
 * file's history, and each is cheap to re-break by accident:
 *
 *   R1  Every registered tool has exactly one entry in the capability policy.
 *   R2  Every policy entry names a registered tool. Drift runs both ways — a renamed tool leaves a
 *       stale entry behind, and a stale entry is worse than a missing one because it looks handled.
 *   R3  The registered count matches the count the policy declares it covers. Two comments in this
 *       repo said 117 while the real number was 119; a number written in prose rots silently, so it
 *       is asserted instead.
 *   R4  The single `tools/call` chokepoint still calls the governed adapter. If the call disappears,
 *       every tool is ungoverned and nothing else in CI notices.
 *   R5  No SECOND dispatch door. A new `server.tool`/`mcp.tool` registration on a different server
 *       instance, or a second handler branching on `tools/call`, bypasses the chokepoint entirely.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/ci/mcp-governed-door-lint.mjs
 * Self-test: node scripts/ci/mcp-governed-door-lint.mjs --self-test
