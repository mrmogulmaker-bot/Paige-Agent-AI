/**
 * The §9/§53 tenant-scope guards on the two comms webhooks — armed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `twilio-status-callback` and `handle-inbound-sms` are this branch's headline
 * repairs: a delivery receipt must only advance the authenticated tenant's own
 * message, a tenant-authenticated callback must never reach the platform-tier
 * operator store, and an inbound text must only resolve a contact inside the
 * tenant that owns the receiving number.
 *
 * All three were enforced in code and covered by NOTHING. `vitest.config.ts` is
 * `include: ["src/**"]`, so no edge function is reachable by the unit suite, and
 * the existing smokes cover `voice-twiml` plus the pure auth module only. An
 * independent review demonstrated that deleting any one of these three guards
 * left every gate green — the branch's own §9 fixes could be reverted by a later
 * refactor without a single red check.
 *
 * So this drives the REAL handlers and asserts on what they actually READ and
 * WRITE, not on their prose. Only the Supabase client and the Deno global are
 * substituted; routing, authentication and scoping are the shipped code.
 *
 * READS ARE NOT WRITES. The recorder tags each recorded query with the verb that
 * built it, because the scope assertions are about the LOOKUP that selects a row.
 * A follow-up `update(...).eq("id", row.id)` is correctly keyed on the primary key
 * and carries no tenant_id; folding it into the same bucket would have made the
 * scope assertion fail for a reason that is not a defect.
