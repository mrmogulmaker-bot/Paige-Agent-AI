/**
 * Data-boundary stub for the Settings › Connections › Calendars harness mount.
 *
 * MOCKS THE PROVIDER, NEVER THE CONTRACT (harness README). The shipped
 * `CalendarsView`, the shipped `useCalendarConnections` and the shipped CSS are
 * all under measurement — only the Supabase transport is replaced, and it answers
 * with the exact shapes the real seams return.
 *
 * THE ROWS ARE VISIBLY SYNTHETIC ON PURPOSE. Names read "Harness …" so a frame
 * can never be mistaken for a tenant's real configuration and no invented person
 * appears in an artifact (§13/§63).
 *
 * WRITES PERSIST HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT (§70). The previous version routed
 * `.update()` and `.insert()` into a chain that ignored them and re-resolved the
 * same read, so a save "succeeded" and nothing changed. A geometry harness can
 * live with that; a harness meant to prove a HUMAN can finish a job cannot —
 * every drive would have been asserting against a value that was never written.
 * The store below is a real in-memory table set: an update mutates the row and
 * returns the MUTATED row, an insert appends and returns what it appended, and a
 * re-read sees both. That is what makes "create it, change it, save it, and see
 * it hold" provable rather than assumed.
 *
 * It is still a double. It proves the surface drives its own contract correctly.
 * It proves NOTHING about production RLS, Postgres constraints, or a real
 * provider, and must never be reported as having done so.
 *
 * `?data=` selects the state under measurement:
 *   dense (default) · issues · readonly · hostserror · empty · error
