/**
 * Dev-only mount for the WHOLE Solo Settings route, so the harness can measure a
 * real render of every destination a session cannot log in to reach.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `connections-mount`. That harness hand-builds
 * `.solo-settings`, `.ss-page-head` and `.ss-content` around a bare `CalendarsView`.
 * It therefore never runs `SoloSettings` itself — not its scroll-owner resolution,
 * not its scroll reset, not its destination switch. A surface's own scroll logic
 * cannot be measured by a harness that reimplements the markup that logic keys on.
 * Here the mounted component IS `SoloSettings`, and the only thing around it is the
 * shell.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL: the shipped `SoloSettings` and every destination it renders, the
 * shipped data hooks, the shipped `settings.css` / `settings-integrations.css` /
 * `connections-calendars.css`, the shipped tenant-shell CSS, and the shell's real
 * element chain including SoloApp's screen host. Only the Supabase transport and
 * the tenant context are stubbed — and both are the SAME modules `connections-mount`
 * uses, not a second copy (§18).
 *
 * `BrowserRouter`, not `MemoryRouter`: Settings derives its destination from the URL
 * via `useSubtabRoute`, and its `segmentSpent` decision lives in history state. A
 * drive must be able to navigate by address and to reload, which memory routing
 * cannot express.
 *
 * The `?host=clipped` mode re-creates the pre-#681 SoloApp host (`overflow:hidden`
 * at `height:100%`) so a drive can prove its reachability checks FAIL when the
 * scroll owner is taken away. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (§13/§32.c): a local render is not a deployed one, and
 * the rows are synthetic. It proves GEOMETRY, SCROLL OWNERSHIP, KEYBOARD REACH and
 * DESTINATION SWITCHING — never production data or production behaviour.

 * surface that overflows its ancestor is reachable in a faked shell and unreachable
 * in the real one, which is precisely how a clipped Settings measured as healthy.
 *
 * `.tcs-main--settings-scrollbar` is deliberately NOT pre-applied here.
