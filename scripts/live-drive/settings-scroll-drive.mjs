/**
 * Settings scroll-reachability drive — can a human reach every control on every
 * Solo Settings destination, at every viewport we support?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The scroll-host defect repaired in #681 was invisible to the
 * checks that were supposed to catch it, because "no horizontal overflow" and "no
 * nested scrollers" are BOTH satisfied by a surface with no scroll owner at all.
 * Neither asked the only question that matters. This drive asks it directly, per
 * destination: is the last actionable control reachable — by wheel, by the End key,
 * by PageDown and Space, by dragging the scrollbar, and by tabbing to it?
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES AGAINST. The real `SoloSettings` component, inside the real
 * tenant-shell element chain and the real SoloApp screen host, with the shipped
 * stylesheets — see `harness/settings-mount/main.tsx`. Not a hand-built test shell:
 * a faked scroll owner is exactly how a clipped surface measured as healthy.
 *
 * HONEST CLASSIFICATION, NOT A UNIFORM PASS. A destination shorter than the viewport
 * has nothing to scroll, and asserting reachability there would pass vacuously. Each
 * destination is therefore classified per viewport as OVERFLOWS (full battery) or
 * FITS (assert nothing is clipped and no scroll owner is needed) — and the report
 * says which, so a destination that quietly stops overflowing cannot be mistaken for
 * one that was proven reachable.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE (§13/§32.c): a local render is not a deployed one and the
 * rows are synthetic. It proves GEOMETRY, SCROLL OWNERSHIP and KEYBOARD REACH — never
 * production data, production authorization, or the authenticated surface.

/**
 * THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS, and an honest note on why one of them changed meaning.
 *
 * Until this PR, `?host=clipped` WAS the proof that the battery could fail: it put
 * SoloApp's `full`-route host back to inline `overflow:hidden`, the surface lost its
 * only scroll owner, and the reachability checks went red. That is no longer true,
 * and pretending otherwise would be the false green this drive exists to kill.
 *
 * The reason is the repair itself. Settings' scroll ownership is now decided by an
 * !important CSS declaration, which outranks ANY inline style on the host — including
 * the clipped one. So the clipped host can no longer take the scroll owner away, and
 * asserting that it does would be asserting something now false.
 *
 * The right response is to assert what is now TRUE and hand the failure-proving duty
 * to a control that can still discharge it:
 *
 *   • `?host=clipped` now proves HARDENING — Settings stays reachable even if the
 *     `full` list is changed back, so this surface can never silently lose its scroll
 *     owner to a route-list edit again. That is the class of regression #681 was, and
 *     this is the check that catches its return.
 *   • Deleting the opt-out rule from the live stylesheet is the control that still
 *     goes red on demand, and it is asserted below.
 */
/**
 * The design-locked surfaces, proven still form-fitting. These are the REAL screens
 * SoloApp mounts, in the IDENTICAL chain and stylesheets — not a stand-in — so the
 * question they answer is the one that matters: did the Settings opt-out leak?
 *
 * `home` is Command Center, which is where Systems Check and Mind live, so both are
 * exercised by opening it and switching to Mind. Their host must compute `hidden`
 * and must not overflow: Solo screens own their internal scroll regions and fill the
 * frame. If any of these turns scrollable, the opt-out is no longer Settings-only and
 * a locked interaction policy has moved.
