# Commercial terms — proof that every refusal raises a code the surface can act on.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `tenant_client_agreements` had zero rows in production and nobody could say why:
# 30 of the 38 refusals in the two writers were bare `RAISE EXCEPTION`, defaulting to P0001, which
# the surface maps to nothing and renders as "The save could not be confirmed." Coding them is only
# half a fix — a migration that merely *contains* the right text proves nothing about what a caller
# receives. This drives the real functions and asserts the SQLSTATE and the message that come back.
#
# It stands up a throwaway cluster, so it needs no credentials and touches no real database.
#
#   ./scripts/sales/commercial-terms-refusal-proof.sh
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE (§13). The dependencies are STUBS — `is_tenant_admin` returns true and
# `current_user_tenant_id()` is fixed — so this proves the REFUSAL VOCABULARY, not tenant isolation
# or role enforcement. Those live in the full-schema pgTAP suite. A green run here means every
# refusal a caller can trip announces itself with a code; it does not mean the gates are correct.
