/**
 * The Chat egress boundary — what a provider may and may not put in front of the model.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `paige-ai-chat` ends every tool call with
 * `toolResults.push({ role: "tool", content: JSON.stringify(result) })`. Whatever an
 * MCP provider returns therefore lands in the model's context verbatim. An MCP server is
 * tenant-configured and provider-operated: its response is UNTRUSTED INPUT, and it is
 * simultaneously a prompt-injection surface, a credential-exfiltration surface and a
 * cross-tenant surface. "It has always been consumed this way" describes who reads it; it
 * does not authorise it.
 *
 * So this drives the REAL client and the REAL projection against hostile responses and
 * asserts on the exact bytes that would reach the model.
 *
 * FAILING FIRST. Run with `--baseline` to point the same assertions at the behaviour that
 * shipped before this change — the raw JSON-RPC envelope handed straight to the model.
 * Every containment assertion fails there. That is the defect, demonstrated rather than
 * described, and it is what the pass below is measured against.
