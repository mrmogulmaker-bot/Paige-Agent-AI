# INT-163 — executable proof that the agreements engine's integrity guarantees are real.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every immutability claim in `20270401000000_agreements_engine_records.sql` — the
# one-way status machine, the freeze at send, the write-once seal, the append-only audit trail, the
# cross-tenant refusal — is enforced by a TRIGGER, because RLS does not bind `service_role` and the
# real writers are service-role edge functions. A trigger that is believed to fire and does not is
# indistinguishable, in the schema, from one that works. So this drives each guarantee and asserts
# the exact SQLSTATE, and it drives POSITIVE controls too: negatives that pass because the statement
# was malformed prove nothing at all.
#
# It stands up its own throwaway cluster, so it needs no credentials and touches no real database.
#
#   ./scripts/agreements/run-integrity-proof.sh
#
# Exit 0 means every negative was refused with the expected code and every positive succeeded.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE (§13). The fixture schema is a stand-in for the real `clients` /
# `tenant_products` / auth-helper surface, and it is NOT production. One property is deliberately
# NOT reproduced and was previously mis-stated here: the cluster is created with
# `initdb -U proofrunner`, so these tables are owned by the BOOTSTRAP SUPERUSER, not by a
# non-superuser role as on Supabase. What the service-role section does prove is the part that
# matters for the trigger guarantees — `service_role` BYPASSRLS, is not a superuser, and is not a
# member of the owning role, so it cannot disable a trigger or set session_replication_role.
# Confirming the same behaviour on prod is a separate §32 step for a session with database access.
