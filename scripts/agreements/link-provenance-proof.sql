-- INT-163 / #1395 — proof that the MANUAL LINK door refuses the same blank document the SEND door
-- refuses, and that it refuses nothing else.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AS A PROOF RATHER THAN A CLAIM. The defect it guards against was invisible
-- precisely because the code path LOOKED correct: `issue_agreement_signing_link` already refused to
-- freeze an uploaded document, so reading it gave the impression uploads were handled. It was the
-- ALREADY-frozen row it had nothing to say about, and no assertion anywhere exercised one. So this
-- drives both an affected row and an unaffected one, and asserts on the MESSAGE and not only the
-- SQLSTATE — the pre-existing refusal on this path raises 23514 as well, so a state code alone
-- cannot tell "refused for the right reason" from "refused for the old one".

-- NO FIXTURE INSERTS A SIGNER. `trg_agreement_seed_counterparty` (20270405000000:103) seeds the
-- counterparty from the contact's email on insert, so every agreement below already has exactly one
-- signer at position 1 — which is the shape a real agreement has. Adding another by hand produced a
-- second row at the same position, and `signing_order` is unique only by the body of
-- `add_agreement_signer` (20270405000000:183) and not by any index, so nothing would have refused it.

-- Like pg_temp.probe in contract-proof.sql, but it also inspects the message. Both emit the same
-- failure vocabulary the runner greps for, so a regression here fails the run without the runner
-- needing to know what this file asserts.
