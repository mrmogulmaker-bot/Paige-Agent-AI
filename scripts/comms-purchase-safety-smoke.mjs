/**
 * comms-purchase-number — the four decisions that surround SPENDING MONEY.
 *
 * Vitest covers `src/**` only and no edge function carries a test, so this is the §32 smoke
 * for the function that starts a recurring charge. It drives the REAL shipped handler: the
 * module is bundled, `Deno.serve` is captured, and actual `Request` objects go in and actual
 * `Response` objects come out. Only the two seams a local run genuinely cannot supply are
 * substituted — the Supabase client and the Twilio purchase — and both substitutes record what
 * they were asked to do so the assertions can be about behaviour rather than about a mock.
 *
 * WHY EACH ASSERTION EXISTS. Every one below corresponds to a defect an adversarial review
 * found in code that had already passed a green proof, and every one is paired with the state
 * that would have made the old code wrong:
 *
 *   1. `code` on the charged-but-unrecorded path. `error` interpolates the database message,
 *      so a consumer comparing it for equality never matched and the "money already spent"
 *      signal was silently lost on the one path where money had left.
 *   2. An audit row on EVERY money-spent exit. `twilio_purchase_missing_sid` returns after
 *      Twilio accepted the purchase and used to write nothing at all, so a charge could exist
 *      with no trace in either `tenant_phone_numbers` or `audit_logs`.
 *   3. A quoted price is VERIFIED before the buy, not after. An agent composes its own
 *      approval sentence, so without this the amount a human approved and the amount they are
 *      billed were unrelated.
 *   4. The UI producers, which send no price, are untouched — a half-applied guard that 4xxs a
 *      legitimate caller is worse than no guard (§37).

       is exactly why the agent path must never let a malformed quote decay into an absent one —

       unverified, and at `auto` with no confirmation shown at all.
