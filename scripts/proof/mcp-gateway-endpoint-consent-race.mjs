// Connected MCP Gateway — the approval-write vs endpoint-change RACE is closed (#1262 finding 3).
//
// set_mcp_connection_approval takes a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock on the connection before it
// records the approval, so it and any UPDATE of server_url_ct (which fires the 20270322000000
// revoke trigger) contend on the SAME row lock and cannot interleave. This proof forces the two to
// overlap (each holds its transaction open with pg_sleep) and asserts the invariant that the race
// would otherwise break: no approval is ever left bound to an endpoint the connection no longer
// has. Without the FOR UPDATE lock, the writer could read the old endpoint, the endpoint could
// change (deleting nothing, since the write hasn't landed), and the write could then commit a
// stale approval — exactly the interleaving this serialization prevents.
//
// Two concurrent psql processes (no pg dependency), mirroring scripts/proof/business-mission-concurrency.mjs.
//
// HONESTY (§13, §39 adversarial): with the FOR UPDATE lock present this passes deterministically.
// As a REGRESSION guard it is probabilistic — if the lock were removed, the stale-approval
// interleaving becomes reachable but is not guaranteed on every run (a plain SELECT does not wait
// on the row lock), so a single green run is a positive proof of correctness, not a hard tripwire
// against a future lock removal. The deterministic guarantee is the endpoint_hash binding, proven
// in mcp_gateway_durable_endpoint_bound_consent.sql.
