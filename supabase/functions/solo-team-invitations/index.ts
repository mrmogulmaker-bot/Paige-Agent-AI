 * conversation is about. It is NOT trusted here and is not resolved here. It travels to
 * `solo_team_invite_authority`, which proves the actor's active owner/admin membership in that exact
 * workspace and refuses otherwise. A client can therefore use it to ABORT a call and can never use
 * it to select a workspace it has no authority in.
 *
 * It is deliberately not defaulted, not inferred, and not validated into something plausible here.
 * The whole defect this endpoint was repaired for was a server that filled in a workspace nobody
 * named, so a missing value must reach the database and be refused there, by the one authority.
