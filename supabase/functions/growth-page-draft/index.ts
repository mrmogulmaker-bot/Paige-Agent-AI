// growth-page-draft — Paige's landing-page generator (Growth OS / Vibe Studio #86).
//
// From one sentence, Paige drafts a branded landing page: a set of GrowthBlocks (a hero +
// an embedded lead/signup form at minimum), a theme seeded from the tenant's real brand
// cascade, and SEO. PURE DRAFT — zero DB writes. Publishing is a separate, approval-gated
// action (§8/§10) handled by growth_page_publish, which returns the real resolved URL (§13).
//
// Sibling: growth-block-edit revises ONE section of a page. This generates the whole page.
// Both bottom out in the SAME 17-type block contract, shared in _shared/growth-blocks.ts —
// one validator, one spec, one set of length caps. (This file used to carry a verbatim fork
// whose rich_text cap was 6000 while the SQL gate and its own prompt said 20000; it silently
// truncated legitimate long-form copy. Migrating to the shared module fixes that.)
//

//
// ── SECURITY (§13 — tenant isolation, least privilege) ──────────────────────
// This function does NOT trust `tenant_id` from a JWT caller. It resolves the tenant
// SERVER-SIDE via current_user_tenant_id() executed in the CALLER's own JWT context — the same
// pin growth_page_upsert / growth_page_edit_blocks use ("JWT callers: client tenant ids
// IGNORED"). It is SECURITY DEFINER over auth.uid(), so it physically cannot return a tenant
// the caller doesn't belong to. Only a service-role bearer — Paige's agent driving this
// headlessly (§10) — may name a tenant explicitly. The service-role key is used ONLY to read
// brand for the tenant WE resolved, never for a tenant the caller named.
// (This closes a live cross-tenant IDOR: the previous revision read `body.tenant_id` at face
// value and fetched that tenant's brand with the service-role key, so any authenticated coach
// could read any tenant's brand by naming its UUID. Owner-approved fix, mirrors growth-block-edit.)
//
// Doctrine:
//   §2  — defaults are coaching-generic (webinar, coaching offer, lead magnet, consultation).
//         We never ADD credit/funding/lending framing. A tenant who asks for a funding page in
//         their brief gets one — their offer is theirs; it is just never a platform default.
//   §3  — mogul-direct voice; no "AI-powered/streamline/seamless/empower".
//   §10 — callable seam: the Studio is one caller, Paige's agent is another.
//   §13 — structured errors, real causes, non-2xx on failure; theme_json is seeded from the
//         REAL brand cascade (resolve_tenant_brand), not hallucinated, so it is truthful.
//   §14 — model-routed, reasoning tier, never a hardcoded model.
//   §15 — the model must NOT invent specifics (dates, Zoom links, testimonial names). When the
//         brief lacks them it emits ZERO bracketed tokens (a raw "[ADD_DATE]" ships to a live page
//         AND is hard-rejected by growth_page_publish) — it uses a real value, omits the element, or
//         words the copy so no missing specific is needed. Never fake data. Same rule
//         extends to `suggested_delivery`: the model may only ever point at an attachment index
//         WE actually included (never invent one), and even then this function is the last line
//         of defense — it drops any index the model returns that doesn't correspond to a
//         real, successfully-attached file before it ever leaves this function.

    // ── 5. The draft ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    const SYSTEM = `You are Paige, drafting a high-converting landing page for a client-based service business${brandName ? ` called "${brandName}"` : ""}. You output the page as a structured set of content blocks.

VOICE (§3): direct, confident, mogul-founder. Never use "AI-powered", "streamline", "seamless", or "empower". Write for a broad client-based-services audience — coaches, consultants, agencies, advisors, thought leaders — using inclusive words (practice, business, clients, work) rather than narrowly "coaching".

DEFAULTS (§2): the offer defaults to a coaching-generic play — a webinar/masterclass, a free consultation or strategy call, a coaching program, or a lead magnet. Do NOT introduce credit, funding, lending, loans, financing, or "readiness/funding score" framing UNLESS the brief explicitly asks for it. (If the brief DOES ask for it, that is the operator's own offer and you write it in their voice — the rule is that you never ADD it.)${practiceBlock}${fundingEnabled ? `\n\nSCOPE (§2 — funding is opt-in ON for THIS tenant): this practice offers funding & capital-raising coaching, so credit, business credit, funding, lenders, and capital strategy ARE in scope for this page — write them in the operator's own voice when the brief calls for them. Never invent offers the practice does not actually provide.` : ""}

COPY CRAFT — the direct-response bar this page is held to (the gap between a page that converts and one that doesn't): name a SPECIFIC dream outcome and timeframe in the headline, never a vague benefit — "your first paying client in 30 days" beats "grow your business." Conversion is a ratio: maximize the reader's perceived likelihood of success (a clear mechanism, real specificity, proof) while minimizing their sense of required time and effort — every section should be doing one of those two jobs. Agitate a real, named problem the reader already recognizes in themselves before you resolve it — a claim with no friction behind it reads as filler. Write with an actual point of view, not corporate-anonymous voice; when it fits the brief, frame the offer as the non-obvious move that works, not the obvious path everyone already tried. Every claim is a concrete number you were actually given, or it is cut — never a hollow adjective standing in for a number, and never a bracketed placeholder standing in for one.

TIER CHECK — before you finalize, grade your own draft. Premier / top-level copy is marketplace-scale: a stranger with zero context reads it and feels the specific outcome is real and worth acting on now — sharp enough to sit next to the best-performing page in the category. Low-tier / basic copy is generic filler dressed up as a page — safe, vague, forgettable, written to close the request rather than close the sale. Ask yourself plainly: "is this the kind of copy that actually helps this business sell and grow, or did I just generate something to satisfy the brief?" If any section reads as the latter, rewrite that section before you return the page — never ship the first pass just because it's technically complete.

NO FABRICATION, NO PLACEHOLDERS (§15): do NOT invent specifics you were not given — no fake dates, times, Zoom/webinar links, prices, testimonial names, quotes, or statistics. And do NOT emit a bracketed editable token either — no "[ADD_WEBINAR_DATE]", "[PASTE_LINK]", "[YOUR_RESULT]", or any [BRACKETED] token, ALL-CAPS or not. A raw placeholder ships straight to a live, prospect-facing page and reads as broken. When you don't have a specific, do ONE of three things: (a) use a real value the brief or the THIS PRACTICE context above actually gives you; (b) OMIT the element entirely — drop the countdown, the dated line, the price, the unattributed testimonial; a shorter page with only real content is correct and premium; or (c) word the copy so it needs no missing specific — "Save your spot for the next live masterclass" not "on [DATE]", "Book a call" not a made-up time. Output zero bracketed tokens.

OUTPUT — return ONLY a single JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences:
{
  "blocks": GrowthBlock[],
  "seo_json": { "title": string, "description": string }
}

${GROWTH_BLOCK_SPEC}

URL & DATE RULE (hard, §15/§13): "media", "image", and "gallery" blocks — and any image_url/avatar_url field — need a REAL https:// URL you were actually given. You do NOT have tenant asset URLs. So do NOT emit these blocks (or these fields) with a placeholder, a bracket token, an http link, or a made-up URL — OMIT the whole block/field entirely. Same for "countdown": only include it if the brief gives a real date; never invent one. A page with no real media is correct; a page with a fake video/image link is a defect that will be rejected.

REQUIRED for every page: the FIRST block MUST be a "hero", and the page MUST include exactly one "embedded_form" block (the webinar/lead signup) — set its "form_slug" to a short kebab-case slug describing the signup, e.g. "webinar-signup" or "strategy-call". Do not fabricate the form's fields here; the form is drafted separately. For hero/cta buttons that should scroll to the form, use "cta_href": "#apply". Aim for a hero, two or three supporting blocks chosen from the list above (e.g. feature_grid, phase_cards, testimonial, faq, stats, pricing, steps), a cta, and the embedded_form — tight and premium, not padded. Pull only from the blocks the brief can truthfully support.`;

    // case it becomes a real Anthropic content-block array (text + image/document blocks) so
