// ${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/voice-twiml. Twilio POSTs application/x-www-form-urlencoded
// here on BOTH directions and we answer with TwiML:
//   • OUTBOUND — a browser Device did device.connect({params:{To}}). Twilio hits this with
//     From="client:<tenantId>.<userId>" (the AUTHENTICATED identity from the access-token
//     grant) + To=<dialed PSTN number>. We resolve the tenant FROM the identity, look up
//     that tenant's OWNED caller-ID number, and <Dial><Number> the callee presenting it.
//   • INBOUND — the tenant's Twilio number rang. Twilio hits this with To=<tenant number>
//     + From=<external caller>. We resolve the tenant that OWNS the To number, then
//     <Dial><Client> the tenant's registered browser seat(s).
//
// DOCTRINE
//  §9  Tenant isolation on BOTH directions, from a NON-forgeable field, never a trusted body:
//        - outbound tenant = the authenticated `client:` identity Twilio derived from the JWT
//          grant (the browser cannot forge another tenant's identity — the token is scoped);
//        - inbound tenant  = the OWNER of the dialed To number (tenant_phone_numbers), so a
//          caller is only ever bridged to seats of the tenant whose number they dialed. A
//          caller can NEVER reach another tenant's client.
//  §53 PHASE 3 — the OPERATOR (God/Super-Admin) scope runs on the platform MASTER account and is
//      TENANT-LESS. OUTBOUND: a `client:operator.<userId>` caller presents the MASTER caller-id
//      (operatorVoiceCallerId, env) — never a tenant number — intercepted BEFORE the tenant parse.
//      INBOUND: a call to the master number (owned by NO tenant) rings the operator seat(s)
//      (super_admin/platform_admin), never a tenant. Operator call rows write ONLY to
//      operator_messages/operator_conversations (is_platform_owner()-gated, NO tenant_id) — the two
//      scopes never mix (§9/§51). No co-pilot fork on the operator scope (that is tenant STT).
//  §13 Honest degrade — no owned caller-ID / unknown number / no seat available speaks a plain
//      message and hangs up. Never a dial with a bogus callerId, never a silent 500, never a
//      fabricated bridge. On the operator scope: no configured operator caller-id → the same honest
//      spoken degrade (owed secret TWILIO_OPERATOR_CALLER_ID), never a bogus dial.
//  §18 verify_jwt=false (Twilio can't present a Supabase JWT). Reuses the ONE Twilio seam's
//      canonical validateTwilioSignature (no fourth inline copy) + the ONE phone normalizer.
//  §32 The request-shaping logic (direction, identity parse, TwiML) is PURE + unit-smoked
//      (./twiml.ts + scripts/voice-twiml-smoke.mts). Every degrade path LOGS loudly.
//  §3  Every spoken <Say> is plain and jargon-free (copy lives in ./twiml.ts).

  //   - if the fork IS activated, this is a real regression of a previously-shipped

  // The TwiML we return here is the HTTP RESPONSE BODY handed to whoever POSTed. A stamped
  // URL therefore DISCLOSES `inbound_webhook_secret` to the caller. That is safe only when
  // we know the caller is Twilio. This function is `verify_jwt = false`, and in the prod
  // credential model TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN is deliberately ABSENT — so without this gate an
  // anonymous POST of `From=client:<any tenantId>.<any userId>` would have made us look up
  // that tenant's secret and hand it back in `<Number statusCallback="…?t=SECRET">`. The
  // holder of that long-lived secret can then forge inbound SMS, suppressions and consent
  // events against the tenant — i.e. it would have handed away the very fail-closed posture
  // the rest of this change establishes.
  //
  // An earlier revision of this block called `From` "the AUTHENTICATED client identity …
  // never a raw parameter (§9)". That is true of Twilio's own request and FALSE of an
  // unsigned one: with no signature to check, every field here is attacker-supplied. §9
  // scope is only as non-forgeable as the authentication underneath it.
  //
  // So: emit a secret-bearing (or signature-authenticated) callback ONLY on a verified
  // request. Unverified ⇒ NO callback at all. The honest cost is stated in §13 terms below.

  // §13 — the honest degrade, named rather than silent. While voice webhooks cannot be
  // authenticated we emit no completion callback, so the voice row keeps its non-terminal
  // status (no duration/recording/transcript stamp). That is a REAL capability loss versus
  // the fail-open predecessor, logged on every call so it shows up in the function logs
  // rather than as missing data weeks later.
  //
  // WHAT LIFTS IT — and what does NOT. The remedy is per-subaccount signature validation.
  // It is specifically NOT "set the master TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": tenant numbers live on
  // SUBACCOUNTS, which Twilio signs with the SUBACCOUNT's token, and the check above has no
  // shared-secret fallback and a hard 403 — so setting the master token would reject every
  // legitimate tenant voice webhook and no tenant call would bridge at all.
  //
  // The SMS siblings do not have this problem, and the difference is the point:
  // `_shared/twilio-webhook-auth.ts` deliberately does NOT return on a failed signature when
  // a stamped secret is also offered, precisely so that setting the master token cannot turn
  // every correctly-stamped tenant callback into a 401. It avoids the trap by falling through
  // to the shared secret. This function has no such fallback, so for it the trap is real.
  // (An earlier revision of this comment cited that module as issuing the warning, which
  // misread a hypothetical it guards against as a standing caution. The conclusion was right;
  // the attribution was not.)
  //
  // FORWARD NOTE for whoever implements per-subaccount validation: "the outbound tenant is
  // non-forgeable" holds only if the validator BINDS the signing subaccount to the tenant
  // claimed in `From`. Without that binding, a request signed with tenant A's subaccount token
  // carrying `From=client:<tenantB>.<user>` would verify, and the outbound branch would then
  // stamp tenant B's secret. That belongs in the follow-up's acceptance criteria.
  //
  // An earlier revision of this comment named the master token as a remedy; that was wrong
  // and operationally dangerous, and is corrected here rather than left to be acted on.
