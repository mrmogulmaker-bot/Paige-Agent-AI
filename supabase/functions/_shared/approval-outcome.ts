/**
 * What happened to each approval the operator sent, reported back to the card that asked.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Pressing Approve sends the approved fingerprints and starts a new turn. Until
 * this frame, nothing told the card what became of them: it vanished on press, and the only trace
 * of a failure was whatever Paige chose to say. The owner-approved recovery design (2026-09-26)
 * has the card report each action as ran, didn't run, or couldn't confirm, in a sentence the
 * SERVER writes — so the card can never claim a cause the server does not know, and never
 * improvise a remedy that does not exist.
 *
 * ONE HOME for that decision. The chat handler records the facts as they happen (which approval
 * was spent by which call, which tool's approvals were refused and why, what each call returned);
 * this module turns them into the frame. It is pure so the whole mapping is unit-tested, and so
 * the sentences live in one closed set rather than scattered through the handler.
 *
 * THE SENTENCES ARE A CLOSED SET, AND EACH IS ONLY SAID WHEN IT IS TRUE.
 * - "Nothing changed" is claimed only where the server knows nothing ran: an approval it never
 *   spent, a refusal before the call ran, or a proposal that was re-asked.
 * - A call that failed is "didn't run" ONLY when something positively knows nothing was applied:
 *   the tool said so (`not_applied`), or it is one whose failures are defined that way (the n8n
 *   management tools, which report a write they lost the answer to as `outcome_unknown`). Every
 *   other failure after a spent approval is "couldn't confirm". The asymmetry is the point:
 *   "couldn't confirm" said wrongly costs the person a look; "didn't run" said wrongly offers
 *   "Ask Paige again" for something that already happened, and it happens twice.
 * - "Done" needs the call to have said it succeeded. A result that only fails to mention an error
 *   is not a success.
 * - A call whose answer never arrived is `unconfirmed`, never `not_run`: it may have gone through.
 * - An approval that was already used before this request, and so could not be used in it, is
 *   `unconfirmed` too: whatever used it may have done the work.
