// systems-check-runners/index.ts — the §18 one-home barrel that registers all 10 Systems Check runner
// modules into the core's dispatch map (SYSTEMS_CHECK_DISPATCH) via registerRunner().
//
// A flavor edge function (systems-check-run-onboarding / -scheduled / -change) imports the core AND this
// barrel; importing the barrel is what populates the dispatch registry. The core reports any runner_key
// with no registered runner as an 'error' finding (fail-loud, §32) — so if a registry row's runner_key is
// ever mistyped or a module is missing here, it surfaces loudly, never as a silent pass.
//
// §13: REGISTERED_RUNNER_KEYS is exported so a smoke test / the edge fns can assert the 10 seeded catalog
// keys are all covered before a scan runs.
