/**
 * INT-178 — the governed DRAFT path, the first WRITE PAIGE may make to an agreement.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, AND IT IS THE WHOLE POINT. This drafts. It does not send, resend, void, remind or
 * countersign, and it mints no signing link. Nothing it writes is visible to anyone outside the
 * workspace. The outward-facing keys stay unbuilt until each earns its own slice, for the reason
 * `domains/agreement.ts` gave when the READ half shipped first: the send path has a real client on
 * the other end of it.
 *
 * ONE SEAM, NOT A SECOND SYSTEM (§18). Everything below composes `public.save_paige_agreement`
 * (migration 20270401000000). This module owns no table and writes to none directly; it does not
 * re-implement a single rule the RPC already enforces, and it deliberately does not pre-check any
 * of them — a client-side copy of a server rule is a second policy that drifts.
 *
 * WHY THE CALLER'S CLIENT, NOT THE SERVICE ROLE. Same reasoning the read carries, and it matters
 * more here because this writes. `save_paige_agreement` is SECURITY DEFINER, so §59 requires it to
 * re-prove caller scope in its own body — and it does, through `auth.uid()`: authentication, the
 * expected-tenant comparison, owner-or-admin, and the client's membership of the workspace. Every
 * one of those reads NULL under the service role, so a service-role client would not make this
 * permissive, it would make it unauthenticated and refuse everything. The caller's JWT is both the
 * safe choice and the only working one.
 *
 * NOT IDEMPOTENT ON CREATE, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. With no `agreementId` the RPC
 * INSERTS: a blind retry mints a SECOND draft and a second counterparty signer, because the seed
 * trigger fires per insert. Nothing here dedupes it. The Chat confirmation fingerprint is the
 * execute-once guard, and it is the only one — which is why the capability's idempotency sentence
 * says so in the words an operator would read.
 *
 * ERRORS ARE MAPPED BY CODE, NEVER ECHOED. The RPC's refusals are authored for a human, but they
 * are raised on STANDARD SQLSTATEs (42501 / 23514 / 40001) rather than the reserved `PA###` class
 * this platform uses to mean "a person wrote this sentence for another person". So they are mapped,
 * not forwarded: raw database text must not reach a model or a transcript. The underlying message
 * goes to `console.error`, where an operator can read it and the model cannot.

/**
 * ─── THE SEND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THIS REACHES SOMEONE. It emails each signer a link they can sign with, freezes the presented
 * document as the record of what they were shown, and moves the agreement one way out of draft.
 * Nothing recalls it once delivered. That is why `agreement_send` is classified `high`: the model
 * asserting "they said yes" is refused outright, and only a fingerprint echoed back from a card a
 * person actually saw will run it.
 *
 * IT CALLS THE EDGE FUNCTION, NOT AN RPC, AND FORWARDS THE CALLER'S JWT. `agreement-send` runs its
 * OWN owner-or-admin check against that token — the one that could not bind until recently, so
 * every send refused for everyone. Forwarding the caller's authorization is what makes that check
 * mean something; a service-role call would bypass the very gate this depends on.
 *
 * ONE SEND PER DRAFT IS THE GUARANTEE. EXACTLY-ONCE DELIVERY IS NOT. A second plain send is refused
 * 409 by the status gate, and a signer already holding a live link is reported as not delivered
 * rather than re-mailed. Below that, nothing dedupes — the shared sender records its idempotency
 * key and deliberately does not act on it. Never describe this as exactly-once.
 *
 * `res.ok` IS NOT DELIVERY, and this module does not pretend otherwise: the function answers with a
 * body naming who was sent to and who was not, and that body is the truth. A 2xx with nobody
 * delivered is a real outcome and is reported as one.
