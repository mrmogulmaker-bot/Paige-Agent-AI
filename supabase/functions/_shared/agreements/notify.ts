// legal act; an email announces it. If the announcement fails, the agreement is still completed, the
// signature still stands, and what we do is log loudly and let the owner see the truth in their
// workspace. Rolling back a sealed legal document because a mail provider had a bad minute would be
// destroying evidence to fix a delivery problem.
//
// Everything here therefore returns an outcome and throws nothing at its callers.
