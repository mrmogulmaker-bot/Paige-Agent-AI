// _shared/agreements/signing-guard.ts — the authorization decision for the public signing endpoint.
//
// Pure, so it can be driven exhaustively in tests. The endpoint does IO; this decides.
//
// THE RULE THE WHOLE ENGINE RESTS ON: tenant, agreement and signer are read FROM THE TOKEN ROW and
// from nowhere else. No path segment, query parameter or body field may name or steer any of the
// three. That is the exact inverse of the defect in `docusign-send-envelope`, which takes contact_id
// from the request body and resolves it with the service-role client and no tenant filter.

// WHAT USED TO LIVE HERE AND DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ANY MORE (§58 — removed openly, not silently).
// `signingSecurityHeaders`, `mintNonce` and `signerFacingView` existed for an HTML signing page
// this function no longer serves. The signer's surface is the owner-approved React route
// `/sign/:token`, which carries its own response headers, and the page's read is the
// `peek_agreement_signing` RPC, whose hand-written allow-list is the one home for what a signer
// may be told (proven by K5 in the contract proof). Keeping unused twins of a live rule is worse
// than deleting them: the next reader cannot tell which one governs.

 * `https?:` check and a 400 000-character slice — a slice that can itself break base64 padding — and
 * then detonated inside `sealAndComplete`, one layer ABOVE the deliberate `embedPng` fallback that
 * was supposed to catch it. The signature stood, sealing failed on that call and on every retry, and
 * the signer was told their completed copy was "still being prepared" forever. There is no repair
 * path: `authenticated` holds no UPDATE grant on the column.
 *
 * So the blob is decoded and identified HERE, where the answer is a 400 and the person simply signs
 * again. Truncation is refused rather than performed: silently cutting a payload produces exactly the
