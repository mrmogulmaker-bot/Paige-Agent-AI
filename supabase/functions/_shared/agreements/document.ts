// _shared/agreements/document.ts — rendering, hashing and sealing the document of record (INT-163).
//
// THE INTEGRITY CLAIM THIS FILE HAS TO EARN. When a completed agreement is later questioned, the
// system must be able to say two separate things and prove both: "this is exactly what the signer
// was shown", and "this is exactly what they signed, unaltered since". That is two artifacts and
// two hashes, and the order they are produced in is the whole design.
//
// RENDER ONCE. NEVER RE-RENDER. pdf-lib stamps /CreationDate and /ModDate into the file, so two
// renders of byte-identical content produce different bytes and therefore different hashes. A
// system that re-renders the document each time somebody opens it can hash whatever it likes — the
// hash proves nothing, because the artifact it describes no longer exists. So: one Uint8Array is
// produced at send, uploaded once, hashed, and every later presentation serves THOSE STORED BYTES.
// This file gives the caller no way to do otherwise.
//
// THE SIGNING RECORD CANNOT CONTAIN THE SEALED HASH. A document cannot carry a hash of itself — adding
// the value changes the bytes that the value describes. The signing record therefore lists the
// PRESENTED hash (the thing it is attesting about) and the event log. The SEALED hash is computed
// after the sealed file is saved, and lives in the database, the owner's UI, and the completion
// email. Anyone specifying "print both hashes on that page" has described an impossible
// object, and the only ways to satisfy it are to fake a value or to hash the wrong bytes.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE REUSES RATHER THAN FORKS (§18). Body rendering is `_shared/doc-render.ts`, the one
// structured-content→PDF home. Stamping is pdf-lib directly, the same technique `finalize-agreement`
// already proves in this runtime. There is no third PDF path.

/**
 * A name this engine cannot faithfully put on paper.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN ERROR AND NOT A BEST EFFORT. pdf-lib's StandardFonts encode WinAnsi (CP1252) only,
 * and the sanitiser every stamped string passes through maps anything outside that to `?`. For a
 * heading or a body line that is a cosmetic loss. For the NAME ON A SIGNATURE it is the document
 * asserting that someone called `?????? ??????` signed it — a legal record that is quietly, provably
 * wrong about the one fact it exists to establish. Refusing is the honest outcome, and it is caught
 * at SEND rather than at seal so nobody discovers it after they have already signed.
 *
 * The real fix is a Unicode font: pdf-lib supports it via fontkit and an embedded TTF, neither of
 * which this repo ships today. That is a scoped follow-up, not something to fake in the meantime.
