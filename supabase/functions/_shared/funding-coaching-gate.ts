// THE FUNDING & COACHING TOOLS HARNESS GATE — the ONE HOME (§18) for "may this finance/credit provider
// run for THIS workspace right now?", resolved FAIL-CLOSED before any provider contact (owner ruling
// 2026-09-13).
//
// WHAT THIS IS. The "Funding & Coaching Tools" Marketplace package groups the finance/credit providers —
// NOT the universal Solo baseline (§2: finance/credit is never a platform default; it is an opt-in
// preset). Every provider must REFUSE — before contacting the provider or writing anything — unless the
// server confirms the gating facts below. This module resolves those facts and returns one honest verdict.
//
// SCOPE OF THIS SLICE (§13 — do NOT read "the gate exists" as "all finance provider contact is gated").
// This module is WIRED into THREE provider functions today — `smartcredit-pull-snapshot`,
// `nav-pull-profile`, and `business-verifier` (whose fan-out covers Secretary-of-State, OpenCorporates,
// SEC-EDGAR, D&B, LexisNexis, TransUnion Business, Array) — i.e. 9 of the package's providers. Plaid
// (`plaid-*` / `paige-plaid-*`) and iSoftpull are SEPARATE finance entrypoints NOT gated by this module
// yet; they are owed the same gate in a follow-up slice (their own requireAdmin/auth doors govern them
// until then). Do not mistake "3 functions gated" for "every finance provider contact is package-gated".
//
// THE FOUR FACTS (owner ruling). A provider runs only when all hold:
//   (1) PACKAGE ENTITLEMENT — the tenant holds the Funding & Coaching Tools package. Resolved here from
//       the EXACT `is_finance` predicate the persona resolver uses (mig 20260805130000): an ACTIVE install
//       of ANY `is_finance` marketplace item, OR the generic `tenants.features.finance_in_scope` flag. This
//       module is a second READER of that canonical predicate (exactly as growth-page-draft /
//       paige-public-chat read the flag) — NOT a parallel entitlement system.
//   (2) CONNECTION / CONSENT — the tenant has the required Financial connection OR recorded consent/setup
//       state for the provider. NO per-tenant Financial connection model exists for these providers today,
//       so `resolveFundingProviderConnectionState` returns ABSENT for all of them → the gate refuses.
//       Financial Integrations (owner item 6) will later populate that single read point — DO NOT create a
//       table here.
//   (3) AUTHORITY — the caller has tenant-scoped authority to the target. This stays with each provider's
//       EXISTING door (`can_access_contact` / the business-verifier RLS-read door), which runs and 403s
//       BEFORE this gate. The gate's `authorized` fact is therefore OPTIONAL: the three wired providers
//       omit it (authority resolved upstream); it exists so a future caller that wants the gate to also
//       carry authority can pass it and get a `not_authorized` verdict.
//   (4) GATEWAY / risk / approval / budget — the provider's own governed seam. Unchanged here.
//
// HONEST TODAY (§13). Every provider refuses today — but NOT uniformly because of entitlement. The
// universal refusal rests on the CONNECTION fact: `resolveFundingProviderConnectionState` returns ABSENT
// for all three (no Financial connection model exists yet) → `connection_missing`. Entitlement is NOT
// universally `not_entitled`: the `is_finance`/`finance_in_scope` predicate already resolves `entitled`
// for any tenant carrying `features.finance_in_scope=true` (the mig 20260805130000 backfill of
// `playbook='funding'` tenants). CONSEQUENCE (flag to Marketplace #670 + Financial Integrations #6 BEFORE
// the connection point goes live): once `resolveFundingProviderConnectionState` can return satisfied, ANY
// `finance_in_scope` tenant is immediately allowed — a BROADER set than "installed the Funding & Coaching
// Tools bundle". That breadth is owner-directed (the ruling said reuse the existing is_finance seam), but
// it must be a conscious choice, not a surprise. This module still seeds no install and activates no provider.
//
// FAIL CLOSED ON ANY ERROR (§13/§32). An entitlement READ error resolves to `read_error` → `unavailable`
// (never `entitled`); a missing tenant is `read_error`. The gate never allows on an error it could not
// resolve.
//
// SHAPE. A PURE decision core (`decideFundingCoachingGate`) over injected facts — so the matrix is a unit
// test, not an integration ceremony — plus an ASYNC resolver (`resolveFundingCoachingGate`) that reads the
// two server-side facts, mirroring the pure-core + async-gatherer split of the capability-status seam.
// Imports ONLY types (nothing runtime), so it bundles into every provider function and is portable.
