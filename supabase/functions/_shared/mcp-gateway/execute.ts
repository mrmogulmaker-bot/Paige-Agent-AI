// Connected MCP Gateway — EXECUTE (Slice ③: the runtime dispatch door).
//
// The action that finally RUNS a tool on a connected MCP, composing the hardened, headless-proven
// runner (`runConnectionCapability`, runner.ts) with its PRODUCTION deps — the canonical connection
// loader, the durable consent verifier, the capability resolver, and the canonical-Rail receipt.
// §18/§14: this handler WIRES those existing seams; it re-implements none of the runner's §9,
// single-source, consent, or receipt safeguards.
//
// AUTHORITY (§9). Unlike verify/approve (MANAGE actions gated on tenant-admin), execute is a USE
// action: any authenticated tenant member may ATTEMPT it, and the RUNNER is the authority —
//   * the caller's tenant is server-derived (`current_user_tenant_id`, never the body); the runner
//     refuses a connection whose row-tenant is not that tenant (`foreign_tenant`, §9);
//   * an `owner_only` connection needs the restricted capability, resolved server-side by
//     `_mcp_caller_capabilities` (INT-082/INT-089) — a member who merely learned the id is refused;
//   * a consequential (mutation) tool dispatches ONLY against a durable, endpoint-bound approval
//     (`verify_mcp_connection_approval`), never a pin carried in this request.
// The edge adds ONLY the workspace-switch-race guard (a clean 409 instead of the runner's
// `foreign_tenant` when the caller switched away from the tenant they launched from).
//
// THE "OWNER GO" LIVE GATE (runner.ts:38-40 + §32/§33). A real tools/call is a consequential,
// frequently IRREVERSIBLE external effect that cannot be verified headless (there is no live MCP
// provider in CI). So `mode:"execute"` dispatch is gated behind an explicit owner flag,
// `MCP_GATEWAY_EXECUTE_ENABLED` (default OFF): with it unset the action refuses `execute_not_enabled`
// BEFORE any dep is built or any provider is contacted — exactly the §33 pattern (wire the path live
// and verifiable, keep the consequential runtime behavior behind the owner's own switch, so the
// merge blind-ships no live external effect). `mode:"prepare"` stages intent and contacts NO provider
// (runner.ts:216), so it is always allowed — a UI can confirm a connection+tool is runnable by this
// caller without executing anything.
//
// SECRET DISCIPLINE (§13). The endpoint + credential are decrypted only inside the runner's loader,
// used for one session, and dropped. This handler's response carries a closed outcome vocabulary
// (never provider prose, never a secret): the runner outcome, its closed code, the run id, and
// whether the canonical-Rail receipt persisted.
