// Connected MCP Gateway — CANONICAL CONNECTION resolution (MCP PR-1, single-source).
//
// THE INVARIANT. Consent verification and the eventual dispatch destination must derive from the
// EXACT SAME server-loaded connection record. Phase S/the #1262 runner verified consent against the
// endpoint stored on the connection row (keyed by `connection_id`, via `verify_mcp_connection_approval`)
// but dispatched to a `serverUrl` the CALLER supplied on the request — two independent inputs. A
// caller could then verify consent for connection A's endpoint and dispatch to endpoint B.
//
// This module closes that: the runner never accepts a caller URL. It resolves the endpoint (and auth)
// SERVER-SIDE from the one `mcp_connections` row, keyed by the same `connection_id` that backs
// consent. Both sides then read the same row — a caller cannot influence where a run dispatches.
//
// The production loader is `get_mcp_connection_secret` (migration 20270319000000, service_role only):
// the ONE decrypted read of the row. It is tenant-AGNOSTIC (it loads any connection by id and returns
// the row's `tenant_id`), so the CALLER — here, the runner — must enforce that the row's tenant is the
// caller's server-derived tenant (§9). The auth mapping reuses `authFromSecret` from `../mcp-client.ts`
// (§18: one home; the guard and the mapping already live together there).

//     local-process `stdio` transport are not implemented). The migration is explicit: "client
//     implements http today."
//   • `auth_kind='api_key'` — the n8n REST facet, backfilled 1:1 from `tenant_n8n_connections` with a
//     REST base URL (migration §6b). It is a REST API, NOT an MCP JSON-RPC server. `authFromSecret`
//     maps it through its bearer fallthrough, so WITHOUT this gate the loader would resolve `ok:true`
//     and the runner would POST MCP JSON-RPC to a REST endpoint with the wrong header.
// Both are allow-listed to the facets the client can actually execute, checked BEFORE `ok:true` — so
// `prepare` cannot affirm and `execute` cannot contact a listed-but-non-MCP connection; a non-executable
// facet resolves `connection_unusable`, never a dispatch. Widening the client (real `sse`/`stdio`, an
// `api_key` header scheme) is what widens these sets; until then, refuse.
