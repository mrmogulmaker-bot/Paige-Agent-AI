// Connected MCP Gateway — VERIFY (Slice ①: the probe's first live caller).
//
// A connection created in the registry starts `pending_verification`: the row is a CLAIM
// (an address + a credential) that has never been proven. Postgres cannot make an outbound
// request, so a row can only become `connected` when something reaches the provider, runs the
// MCP handshake read-only, and writes the result through the service-role probe. This module is
// that something, factored out of the Deno edge wrapper so the whole authority + mapping path is
// headless-provable (the wrapper only builds the two clients and translates the result to HTTP).
//
// AUTHORITY (§9/§59). The caller's tenant is resolved SERVER-SIDE from their JWT
// (`current_user_tenant_id`), never from the body. Three gates, all bound to that one active
// tenant, must pass before any secret is read:
//   1. the body's `expected_tenant_id` (if present) equals the server-resolved tenant — the
//      workspace-switch-race guard the sibling `tenant-mcp-connect` established;
//   2. the caller is a tenant admin (`is_current_user_tenant_admin`) — the `manage` gate the
//      G1a-1 writer RPCs require;
//   3. the connection is visible to THIS caller in `get_mcp_connections_v2` (RLS + tenant +
//      owner_only visibility scoped) — a connection in another tenant is simply absent, so a
//      cross-tenant id gets the same `not_found` a nonexistent one does (no IDOR, no info leak).
// `get_mcp_connection_secret` is tenant-AGNOSTIC (service role, loads any id), so after the loader
// resolves the row we RE-ASSERT its tenant equals the caller's active tenant (defense in depth).
//
// SECRET DISCIPLINE (§13). The secret is decrypted server-side inside the loader, used for one
// read-only intake, and dropped. Nothing here returns the server URL, the credential, or raw
// provider text — only status/health, a tool count, and a closed error code the product renders.
