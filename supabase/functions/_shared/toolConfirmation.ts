/**
 * Bind a mutating tool's `confirm:true` to a SERVER-HELD proposal, not to the model's own flag.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE
 * -------------------------------
 * The autonomy gate in `paige-ai-chat` refuses whenever `gateArgs.confirm !== true`, which is a
 * real gate against a caller that just invokes the tool. But `gateArgs` is
 * `JSON.parse(tc.function.arguments)` — the MODEL'S OWN OUTPUT. Nothing tied that flag to the
 * `needs_confirm` that preceded it, or to anything a human said. Two consequences, both reachable:
 *
 *   1. A model emitting `confirm:true` on its FIRST call executed immediately.
 *   2. Worse, the bypass needed no human turn. The tool loop dedupes rounds on the exact argument
 *      string, and `{…}` vs `{…,"confirm":true}` are different signatures — so a model could call,
 *      receive `needs_confirm`, and re-call with `confirm:true` inside the SAME HTTP turn.
 *
 * WHAT MAY AND MAY NOT BE BOUND — the constraint that shapes everything below
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Conversation history is rebuilt as `{ role, content }` ONLY (`index.ts` ~4005). Tool calls and
 * tool results do NOT cross a turn boundary, and the Approve control sends just the words
 * "Approved — run it." So on the confirming turn the model has to REGENERATE its arguments from
 * prose alone.
 *
 * A first version of this module hashed the WHOLE argument object. That is unsatisfiable for any
 * tool whose arguments are authored content — `document_generate` requires `blocks`, the entire
 * document; two generations are never byte-equal. The result was a silent livelock: approve →
 * re-author → different hash → refuse → re-propose, forever, with nothing executing and no error.
 * The peer-gate caught it; neither the SQL proof (hashes passed as literals) nor the unit tests
 * (hand-written 1–2 key objects) could, because neither crosses a turn.
 *
 * So the rule is: **bind only on values the model can genuinely reproduce next turn** — which means
 * either a value the operator SAW in the summary (and can therefore be read back out of prose), or
 * a stable database id the model can look up again. A phone number, a role name, a contact id: all
 * recoverable. A twelve-block document: never. The two tiers are spelt out on TOOL_IDENTITY_FIELDS
 * below, because conflating them is exactly how the first version went wrong.
 *
 * Everything else is bound at TOOL level: a proposal for `document_generate` can only be spent on
 * `document_generate`. Combined with one-open-proposal-per-tool and single use, that gives one
 * approval → one execution, which is the property that actually matters.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT (§13 — the honest bound)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * PROVES: the server proposed first; the operator's client took a turn in between; one approval
 * buys exactly one execution; and for the listed tools, the pinned identity of the approval is the
 * identity that runs.
 *
 * Note the wording: *the pinned identity*, not "the identity the human was shown". For tier 2 the
 * human was shown nothing identifying at all, and the pin buys less than it looks like — a
 * mismatch merely re-renders the SAME sentence, so a second yes executes on the new subject. It
 * costs a round-trip and closes an accidental swap; it does not let the operator tell two subjects
 * apart. Fixing that needs the summary to name its subject, which is filed separately.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE: that the human said *yes* — an intervening turn is a turn, not a grant. Nor,
 * for tools outside the identity list, that the CONTENT is unchanged from what was proposed;
 * only the tool and the fact of approval are bound. Binding to an authenticated approval CLICK is
 * the stronger step and needs per-surface UI work (only `PaigeAIChat` renders `PaigeConfirmCard`;
 * `useSoloChat` drops the confirm frame). Tracked separately rather than half-built here.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — NO SESSION OR THREAD SCOPING
 * -------------------------------------------
 * A proposal is keyed on (requester, tenant, tool, identity) and nothing else. Six surfaces call
 * `paige-ai-chat`, so two open tabs — or the floating chatbot alongside the main console — will
 * silently supersede each other's pending approvals for the same tool. It FAILS CLOSED (the loser
 * is asked again rather than executing), so this is friction, not a hole, and it is stated here
 * rather than left to be rediscovered. The twin this generalizes avoids it by echoing an exact
 * token back through the CLIENT, which is the mechanism this one deliberately does not yet use.
 *
 * Switching active tenant between the proposing and confirming turn has the same effect and the
 * same failure direction, since `personaCtx.tenant_id` is part of the key.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND HOME WAS NOT BUILT (§18)
 * -------------------------------------
 * `pipeline_archive_confirmations` (#709) already implements this shape for ONE tool. This
 * generalizes it instead of forking a rival. That path keeps its own stricter checks on top — an
 * exact token echoed back through the CLIENT, which is the mechanism this one cannot yet use.
 *
 * Kept free of Deno globals on purpose so `src/**` vitest can exercise it directly.
 */

/**
 * Fields a confirming call must reproduce. Adding a tool here makes its approval stricter; adding
 * the WRONG field re-creates the livelock above, so membership has a test — and the two tiers below
 * exist because that test has two honest answers, not one.
 *
 * TIER 1 — the value is rendered in `describeConfirm`, so the operator SEES it and the model can
 * read it straight back out of its own visible prose. Reproduction is essentially certain.
 *     comms_buy_number.phone_number   "Buy +1555…"
 *     member_grant_role.role          'Grant the "admin" role…'
 *     n8n_*_workflow.workflow_id      "…the n8n automation w_123"
 *     zapier_run_action.tool_name     'Run the Zapier action "send_email"'
 *
 * TIER 2 — a stable database id that is NOT in the summary (the summary says "the contact", "a team
 * member", "that number"). The model must re-derive it by looking the subject up again. For a
 * stable row keyed on a name the operator just used, that re-lookup is deterministic in practice —
 * but it is not guaranteed, so the worst case is ONE EXTRA APPROVAL, never an impossibility.
 *     member_grant_role.user_id · member_revoke_role.user_id
 *     crm_delete_contact.contact_id · comms_set_primary_number.number_id
 *
 * That is the whole distinction that matters: a looked-up id can be re-derived; AUTHORED CONTENT
 * cannot. `document_generate`'s `blocks` is a fresh generation every time, which is why pinning it
 * livelocked and why no tier-2 entry may ever be content.
 *
 * These four are pinned anyway because each guards an irreversible or privilege-changing act, where
 * an extra ask costs far less than the wrong subject. (`role` is tier 1 and carries the escalation
 * direction on its own, so even a failed `user_id` match cannot turn a coach grant into an admin
 * one.) That the summaries do not name their subject is a real §13/§36 gap in copy the operator is
 * asked to approve — it is filed separately, not silently fixed here.
 *
 * A tool absent from this map binds at tool level. That is the safe default, not an oversight.
