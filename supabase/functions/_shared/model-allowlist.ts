// _shared/model-allowlist.ts — the Model Router's per-provider model allow-list.
//
// A caller may request a specific model via `model_override` (e.g. a tenant on a Flux
// preset asking for flux-1.1-pro). That override is untrusted input — it must be checked
// against a curated allow-list before it reaches a provider, so no caller can smuggle in
// an unvetted/expensive/renamed model id, drive spend, or route a send to a model we never
// approved (§13 secure-by-construction; §14 cost-low/right-model). An empty/undefined
// override means "use the route's provider default" and is always allowed — the router
// picks the default, not the caller.
//
// This is a plain data + one assertion module (no I/O, no env). Model ids are the current,
// real ids as of 2026-07 for each provider; extend a provider's list here (one home, §12)
// rather than special-casing an id at a call site.
