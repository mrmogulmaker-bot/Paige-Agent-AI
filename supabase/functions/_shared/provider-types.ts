// _shared/provider-types.ts — Shared types for the Vibe Studio model-router provider clients.
//
// Every provider client (openai/groq/ideogram/replicate/meshy, plus claude via the router)
// speaks this ONE result shape so the router can compose them without knowing which vendor
// ran. Kept dependency-free and side-effect-free so the router AND the pure gate layer can
// both import it.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED contract (doctrine §13 — honest by construction): a provider whose API key is
// unset does NOT crash generically and NEVER fakes a success — it throws NeedsConfigError,
// which the router catches and turns into an honest `needs_config` degrade. Keys are read at
// CALL time (Deno.env.get inside the call), never at module load, so secret rotation never
// needs a redeploy.

/**
 * Thrown by a provider client when its required API key is absent. The router catches this
 * at the boundary and returns { needs_config: true, ... } instead of throwing — an honest
 * "this modality isn't configured yet" degrade, never a fake artifact.
