// _shared/eval/gate.ts — §34 Layer 2 (Quality/Evals): the bounded run orchestrator.
//
// runEval takes a RESOLVED tenant id (never body-derived here — the edge fn resolves + authorizes it),
// a set of already-selected cases (or trace rows the caller pre-selected + filtered to the tenant), and
// a scorer set. It runs each scorer over each case, collects ScoreResults, and computes the honest
// aggregate:
//   • aggregateScore = mean over results with a REAL (non-null) score; NULL when nothing scored (never
//     0-coerced — null ≠ zero, §31).
//   • passRate     = fraction passed over the SCORED results; NULL when nothing scored.
//   • degraded     = scoredCount === 0 (the whole run added no real judgment, §13).
//   • costUsd      = sum of the scorer calls' clearly-labeled ESTIMATES.
//
// BOUNDED (§33-style caps so a run can't run away): EVAL_MAX_CASES (default 200) and
// EVAL_COST_CAP_USD (default 5). On either cap it STOPS scoring and marks the run (logged, honest).
//
// NEVER throws into the caller: a scorer throw → an error-status ScoreResult (excluded from the
// aggregate), never a broken run. This module is PURE orchestration; the edge fn does the DB I/O +
// tenant resolution. §34: model-router only (via the judge), no vendor eval SDK.
