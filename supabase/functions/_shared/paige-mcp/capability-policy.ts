/**
 * THE INBOUND MCP CAPABILITY POLICY — one owned mapping, so two naming systems stop drifting.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 * `action-risk.ts` is the platform's one classifier and it holds 62 canonical keys. `paige-mcp`
 * registers 119 tools. The intersection is EXACTLY ONE — `delegate_to_subagent`. Chat says
 * `crm_create_contact`; MCP says `create_contact`. Chat says `crm_delete_contact`; MCP says
 * `bulk_delete_contacts`. So running the MCP surface through `classifyAction` unchanged returns
 * `unclassified` for 118 of 119 tools, which is refuse-by-design — correct as a default, useless as
 * a policy, and indistinguishable from "we never looked".
 *
 * This table is the correction, and it is a MAPPING rather than a second vocabulary. Every entry
 * names the CANONICAL `action-risk.ts` key for the act. Where a canonical twin already exists the
 * entry points at it; where none existed, the key was added to `action-risk.ts` itself. There is
 * one classifier and one namespace, and this file is how the MCP door reaches them.
 *
 * EFFECT IS VERIFIED, NEVER INFERRED FROM THE NAME.
 * Every `effect` below was set by reading the handler body and following its helpers. That is not
 * ceremony: 20 tools in this file mutate behind read-looking names — `handle_data_subject_request`
 * (GDPR erasure), `suspend_tenant`, `confirm_proposal`, `append_client_memory` — and 4 read-only
 * tools carry write-looking names (`get_workflow_run`, `get_skill_run`, `list_communication_log`,
 * `list_email_send_log`). A name-derived policy gets both wrong, and the expensive direction is a
 * mutation declared `read`: `governedExecution.ts` returns before classification, clamp, approval
 * and outcome for a genuine read, so a mis-declared write executes ungoverned. The seam says so
 * itself, and cannot catch it.
 *
 * DENY BY DEFAULT.
 * `lookupMcpCapability` returns undefined for anything absent, and the adapter refuses on undefined.
 * A tool added without an entry does not quietly inherit permissive behaviour — it stops working,
 * and `scripts/ci/mcp-governed-door-lint.mjs` fails the build before it ever reaches production.
 */

/**
 * What the act actually does, verified from the handler. The eleven categories are finer than
