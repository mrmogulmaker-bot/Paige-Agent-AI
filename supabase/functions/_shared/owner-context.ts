// =============================================================================
// §52 — SUPER-ADMIN OWNER RUNTIME CONTEXT composer (Phase 1).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (§36 anchoring miss, 2026-08-09): the God/Super-Admin Paige
// chat opened a session and asked the FOUNDER who he was. Catastrophic for an
// AI-COO — Paige must open EVERY operator session ALREADY knowing who the
// operator is + the live platform state, the same way a real chief of staff
// walks in already briefed.
//
// WHAT THIS BUILDS: ONE compact system block, assembled from FOUR sources, in
// priority order (owner identity first, master excerpt last):
//   1. OWNER IDENTITY / PREFERENCES / PRIORITIES / PERMISSIONS — read from
//      paige_owner_memory rows (§10 config-as-data — the owner's identity is
//      NEVER hardcoded in this edge code; it lives in data the operator can
//      rewrite). If there are NO rows, the whole composer returns null and the
//      caller NO-OPs — Phase 1 never fabricates an operator identity.
//   2. LIVE PLATFORM STATE — REAL queries (tenant counts by revenue_class; real
//      ARR from live Stripe-backed platform subscriptions). Every query has an
//      HONEST fallback line ("not available") — NEVER a fabricated number (§13).
//   3. DOCTRINE §-INDEX — a COMPILED CONSTANT (an edge function cannot read
//      CLAUDE.md at runtime, so the load-bearing §-index is versioned WITH this
//      code, not "read from repo" — §13/§32 honesty).
//   4. MASTER / OWNER-TRILOGY EXCERPT — a COMPILED CONSTANT (Vision · MVP · the
//      4 platform pillars · current gaps), same honesty constraint as (3).
//
// §2/§9 CLEAN: this block ships ONLY to the tenant-less platform owner (the God
// account). It stays coaching-generic — zero credit/funding vertical content —
// exactly like every other platform default. The owner's own memory rows are
// operator/platform-identity content (seeded coaching-generic), never a vertical.
//
// §18 one home: this is the ONE composer for operator runtime context. The
// caller (paige-ai-chat) imports it; it does not fork a second copy.
// =============================================================================

// Structural supabase-js slice — kept loose (mirrors _shared/client-context.ts's
// `supabase: any`) so the module needs no supabase-js import and stays trivially
// unit-testable with a mock client. This is ALWAYS the SERVICE-ROLE client passed
// by the caller (RLS-free reads of operator-only tables); the userId is resolved
// upstream from the VERIFIED JWT (auth.uid()), never a request body (§51/§588).
type AdminClient = any;

interface OwnerMemoryRow {
  memory_type: string;
  content: string;
  created_at?: string;
}

// The memory_type buckets Phase 1 renders, in display order. Rows of any other
// memory_type are ignored here (open vocab, §10 — future types render later).
const MEMORY_SECTIONS: Array<{ type: string; heading: string }> = [
  { type: "identity", heading: "WHO YOU'RE WORKING WITH" },
  { type: "preference", heading: "HOW HE LIKES TO WORK" },
  { type: "active_priority", heading: "WHAT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW" },
  { type: "permission_note", heading: "WHAT YOU'RE CLEARED TO DO" },
  { type: "known_context", heading: "CONTEXT YOU ALREADY HAVE" },
];

// ── (3) COMPILED DOCTRINE §-INDEX — the load-bearing sections, one line each. ──
// Versioned WITH the code (an edge fn can't read CLAUDE.md at runtime, §13). Keep
// SHORT — this is a pointer index, not the doctrine itself.
const DOCTRINE_INDEX = `DOCTRINE §-INDEX (the standing rules you operate under — the full text lives in the repo's CLAUDE.md; this is your working pointer):
- §1/§14 — never work solo; convene a right-sized crew with a verifier. Paige orchestrates a team; she doesn't grind alone.
- §2 — client-based service businesses, never consumer-finance defaults. Funding/credit is an opt-in tenant preset, never a platform default.
- §3 — voice: direct, confident, mogul-founder. Cut tired AI-marketing buzzwords; say what Paige actually does, plainly.
- §4 — merge-on-verified; pre-launch ships straight to live. Don't ask permission to merge verified work.
- §5/§39 — two passes before every ship: adversarial verifier + compliance officer; plus an independent read of the real diff.
- §7/§8 — Paige is the two-way intelligent client portal; she orchestrates two departments (Owner-Ops + Client-Experience) over an action bus.
- §9/§51 — always separate platform (Super-Admin, us) from tenant; every change gets a per-tier availability check.
- §10 — everything stays Paige-governable: every action has a callable seam, config-as-data over hardcoding.
- §11/§25 — world-class is the floor; gold only on the act; see it before you ship it.
- §13/§32 — build like the best; a green build is not a working render; report what actually happened, never a hoped-for result.
- §16 — Paige runs a 10-department $100M org; §17 — the $1B growth map is the revenue north star.
- §18 — search before you scaffold; one home per capability.
- §36 — intuitiveness is the moat: Paige surfaces the work; the operator never has to know how to ask.`;

// ── (4) COMPILED MASTER / OWNER-TRILOGY EXCERPT — Vision · MVP · pillars · gaps. ──
// Also a versioned constant (§13). Kept compact; the full source of truth is the
// repo master doc, which THIS session's operator maintains.
const MASTER_EXCERPT = `PLATFORM SNAPSHOT (your working brief — the full source of truth is docs/PAIGE-MASTER-PROJECT-REFERENCE.md, which the operator maintains):
- VISION: Paige is the intelligent, two-way client portal and the operating system for operational life — an AI COO a non-technical operator can actually run. The intelligence is the moat.
- MVP (Wave 4): the tenant-authored Paige chat + the Vibe Studio (one-session creation of pages/funnels/forms/images) + the Owner-Ops/Client-Experience action bus, per Playbook.
- THE 4 PLATFORM PILLARS: (1) the intelligent portal/chat; (2) the Vibe Studio creation surface; (3) the action-bus orchestration of the two departments; (4) the governance spine (autonomy tiers, audit, tenant isolation, billing taxonomy).
- CURRENT GAPS (as of this build): cross-chat semantic recall is substrate-only (read path unwired); funnel generation depth trails single-artifact drafting; operator runtime-context loading (this feature) is Phase 1.`;
