// _shared/env-key.ts — case-INSENSITIVE provider-secret resolver (the one home, §12/§18).
//
// THE FOOTGUN THIS DEFENDS AGAINST: `Deno.env.get(name)` is CASE-SENSITIVE. When an operator
// sets a secret under a differently-cased name than the code reads — e.g. the dashboard has
// "Gemini_API_Key", "Ideogram_api_key", or "Featherless_API_KEY" while the code reads the
// canonical ALL-CAPS "GEMINI_API_KEY" / "IDEOGRAM_API_KEY" / "FEATHERLESS_API_KEY" — the read
// returns undefined, the provider reports needs_config, and the feature looks "not switched on"
// even though the key IS set. (This is exactly the Gemini-image saga: OpenAI's key matched the
// all-caps read and worked; Gemini's mixed-case key silently read as undefined.)
//
// FIX: resolve keys case-insensitively — but EXACT match wins FIRST, so a correctly-named secret
// behaves EXACTLY as it does today (zero behavior change; the scan is never even reached for it).
// The case-insensitive fallback scan only runs when no candidate matches exactly, keeping the
// common path cheap. The env map is NOT cached, so rotating a secret takes effect immediately.
//
// SECURITY (§13): never logs, echoes, or returns a key VALUE anywhere. It only reads and returns.

/**
 * Resolve the first present, truthy value among the given candidate env-var names.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. EXACT match — for each name in order, return `Deno.env.get(name)` if truthy. This is the
 *      only path a correctly-named secret ever takes, so its behavior is identical to a bare
 *      `Deno.env.get`.
 *   2. Case-insensitive scan — only if no exact match: read `Deno.env.toObject()` ONCE and return
 *      the first entry whose KEY equals any candidate name case-insensitively and whose value is
 *      truthy.
 *   3. Otherwise `undefined`.
 *
 * @param names one or more candidate variable names (e.g. envKey("REPLICATE_API_TOKEN", "REPLICATE_API_KEY"))
 * @returns the resolved value, or undefined if none is set. Never logged.
