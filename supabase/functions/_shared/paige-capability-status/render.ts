// Render the resolved capability manifest into the system block Paige answers "what can you do
// here?" from (Main Paige Operational Chat · P3b, the P0 Defect-1 grounding) — PURE.
//
// The resolver turns server-resolved signals into one honest availability per capability. This
// turns that list into the authoritative system block the model reads. It decides nothing about
// the UI (§00) and imports ONLY the type (erased at transpile) so it is unit-testable through the
// port. It is the WORDS; the truth is the resolved statuses it is handed.
//
// WHY IT IS AUTHORITATIVE (the P0 Defect-1 fix): Paige's tool list and persona make her SOUND able
// to post, text, run workflows and manage a team the instant she is asked "what can you do?". Left
// to the general impression she over-claims — the live defect. This block is injected per turn with
// the workspace's REAL statuses and a directive that it OVERRIDES any general impression: capability
// questions are answered ONLY from here, grouped by what she can do now / prepare for approval /
// that needs setup / that is not built yet — and she never claims an action the block does not mark
// available (§13/§36/§70).
