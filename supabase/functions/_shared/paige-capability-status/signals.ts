// Capability SIGNAL construction (Main Paige Operational Chat · P3b) — PURE.
//
// Piece 3a is the decision core (CapabilitySignal[] → one honest availability each). This is the
// layer above it: it turns the facts the edge dispatch resolves server-side — the caller's tier
// (getActorTier), the ceiling-clamped autonomy lanes (resolve_tool_autonomy), the Spine maturity
// (getSpineCapability) and the real per-tenant connection/provider state — into the signals the core
// grades. It is side-effect-free and imports ONLY types (erased at transpile) so it is unit-testable
// through the port; the async resolution lives in the edge fn, never here.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE MANIFEST (§13/§36/§70, the "what can you do here?" grounding): Paige's tool list
// and persona make her SOUND like she can do everything the instant she is asked, while some of those
// are NOT governed, executable paths. This manifest is the single honest answer — it declares WHICH
// capability families exist and their shape, and the edge dispatch feeds each one its REAL maturity
// (Spine registry where one exists), connection/provider state, and autonomy lane. Two honesty
// directions, both load-bearing:
//   - ANTI-OVER-CLAIM: an action whose governed seam is not registered / not wired into chat (social
//     publish, SMS send, team manage, skills-in-chat, secure browser) resolves through a `null`/
//     UNAVAILABLE maturity → "planned": Paige says it is not something she can do here yet (never
//     implies she can, never falsely claims it doesn't exist).
//   - ANTI-UNDER-CLAIM (the 2026-09-12 completion): several capabilities that GENUINELY ship as
//     governed chat tools — research, document creation, saving to the knowledge base, planning, and
//     delegating to a specialist (the §8 team) — were previously omitted, so "what can you do here?"
//     stayed silent about them. They are modeled now, each grounded in its real lane + (for research)
//     a real provider signal.
// Maturity is NEVER a hoped-for value (§947/§13). It is read from the Spine registry where a row
// exists; for the shipped-but-unregistered chat tools it is synthesized LIVE from the SAME evidence
// the CRM pair uses — a shipped, action-risk-CLASSIFIED, chat-DISPATCHED tool — and each such key is
// documented inline and pinned by the signals test's grounding guard so a future UNDOCUMENTED
// hardcode still fails. Adding a capability is adding a signal here — the decision core does not
// change (§18).
