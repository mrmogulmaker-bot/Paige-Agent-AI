// ── Token pricing — THE ONE HOME (§18) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MEASURED ON PRODUCTION, 2026-09-01. Of 228 tenant-attributable traces carrying tokens, 197 (86%)
// recorded NO cost at all — 15,475,175 of 15,578,931 tokens, 99.3%. The priced 31 all came through
// `model-router`; the unpriced 197 all came through the DIRECT `claude.ts` path, which has the
// provider's own `usage` in hand at its trace site and simply never priced it. Patching six call
// sites would leave the seventh to be found later, so the estimate is filled at the single trace
// WRITER instead, and every caller — present and future — is priced by construction.
//
// WHY ITS OWN MODULE, and not inside `model-router` where the table used to live: `claude.ts` needs
// it and is imported BY the router, so a `claude.ts → model-router` import is a cycle. The platform
// had grown THREE copies of this table as a result — the router's, plus a local one in
// `eval/scorers.ts` whose own comment apologised for it ("estimateCost is not exported from the
// router"). Three tables that can drift apart silently is a §18 defect on its own; each unpriced
// path was the same defect wearing different clothes.
//
// It carries NO imports on purpose. That is what lets the same source be type-checked by Deno for
// the edge runtime AND executed directly by Node for `scripts/token-pricing/check.mjs` — the
// pricing arithmetic is graded by a real test rather than by reading it.
//
// PER-MODEL, not per-provider, for anthropic. The old single "anthropic" price was Claude's
// reasoning-tier rate applied to EVERY Claude call, so 8,535,448 haiku tokens would have been
// booked at roughly 3× their real list price. An estimate that uses the wrong model's list price is
// not coarse, it is wrong (§13) — and it is wrong in the direction that overstates what a tenant
// owes, which is the worse direction.
//
// EVERY PRE-EXISTING PAIRING KEEPS ITS EXACT PRICE. The provider defaults are the previous numbers
// unchanged, so every sonnet-priced path — including the §33 visual-critique cost cap, which routes
// frontier on `claude-sonnet-5` — computes byte-identically. Only models that were demonstrably
// OVER-priced move, and only downward. The check suite pins this as its own case, so a later edit
// that quietly reprices an existing pairing fails rather than passing silently.
