// Honest artifact-creation receipts — Paige Capability System, slice 1 (§13/§70/§32).
//
// The problem this closes: a chat artifact tool (generate_image, draft_marketing_content,
// content_save, document_generate, growth_page_save) calls an edge fn or RPC that can return
// HTTP 200 while carrying no real artifact — a null public URL, an empty drafts array, a null
// saved id. A 200-with-empty-payload does not throw, so the handler's success branch runs and
// emits `{ success: true, ... }`. That receipt is the SAME evidence three consumers read:
//   • the model narrates it ("here's your image") — now a lie,
//   • `describeStep` sets the status label from `success !== false` — shows "done"/"image ready",
//   • the artifact card pushes when `result.success` — a card with no artifact.
// So one dishonest field becomes a dishonest receipt in three places (the §13/§70 defect).
//
// This module is the ONE pure home (§18) for the decision "did the sub-call actually produce the
// artifact this kind promises?" Each handler wraps its own success shape in it, so the honest
// signal is computed once and every downstream consumer inherits it. It is deliberately pure (no
// imports, no Deno/network) so the contract test drives its BEHAVIOUR, not its source text.
//
// What this does NOT do: it does not record a Rail outcome (that is slice 3 / F05 — the ~43
// audit-log-only actions), and it does not touch the going-live publish handlers (external
// publishing is slice 6/7 and needs the publish RPCs' URL return contract verified first). It
// only makes the CREATION receipt truthful.
