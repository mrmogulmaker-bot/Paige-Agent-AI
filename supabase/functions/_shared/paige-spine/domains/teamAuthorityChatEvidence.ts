 * Chat's adapter onto the `team.authority` capability (see ./team.ts).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT routed through resolveSpineEvidence/mindEvidence.ts, for the same reason
 * businessContextChatEvidence.ts is not: that machinery projects durable Rail SIGNAL rows keyed by
 * a client reference, and public.get_team_authority_readiness is a live, stateless read of the
 * caller's own seat. There is no signal to resolve, and the two shapes cannot meet — the resolver
 * sends { p_client_ref, p_limit } and requires subject_type 'client'.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RENDERS: the caller's raw seat role and their legal ownership of this workspace, kept
 * as two facts. Never a name, an email, a user id, a member count, or an invitation count — the RPC
 * itself returns none of those (see the migration header for why each was left out).
