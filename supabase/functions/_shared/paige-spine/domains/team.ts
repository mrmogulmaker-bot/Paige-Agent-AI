/**
 * Team Authority — the two Team-owned authority facts about the CALLER that PAIGE cannot get today:
 * their raw seat role, and whether they are the legal owner of this workspace.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. PAIGE already receives a Team block every turn (get_paige_team_context() ->
 * _shared/team-context.ts) carrying the roster, member_count, and the invitation list. Projecting
 * any of those again would be a second, separately-computed answer to a question already answered.
 * What that block does NOT carry is these two facts kept apart: it computes each person's
 * permission as `is_owner OR role = 'owner' -> 'owner'`, which is wider than the canonical
 * ownership predicate (is_tenant_owner keys on is_owner alone), so a single string ends up meaning
 * membership and ownership at once.
 *
 * Billing-notice eligibility is NOT here. It is a Platform Billing fact that happens to be about a
 * team member, and Billing publishes its own Spine read (public.get_billing_spine_evidence, live on
 * production as of migration 20261140000000). A capability whose facts came from tenant_members AND
 * platform_billing_contacts would blur the ownership line in the registry entry itself.
 *
 * See supabase/migrations/20261150000000_team_authority_readiness.sql for the full trace, and
 * docs/delivery/spine-integration-packet-team.md for the source-to-Spine packet this shipped under.
