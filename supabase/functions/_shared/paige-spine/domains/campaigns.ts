// Campaign BRIEF reach — the conversational create / revise / list path onto the EXISTING governed
// campaign-brief seam (migration 20261225000000). Registered here, in its own domain, so the Chat
// handler consumes it through the Spine (owner ruling 2026-09-01) rather than hand-wiring a tool.
//
// THE HONEST BOUNDARY (§13). A Campaign Brief is strategy and INTENT — an owner-authored planning
// record. It is NOT proof that ads are active, money was spent, content was published, or results
// occurred. Those need their own connected, governed actions and verified outcomes. Every tool
// description below says so, and the RPC's own messages repeat it.
//
// THE AUTHORITY MODEL (owner correction 2026-09-06). Create and revise are classified `ordinary`,
// not `high` — reversible, in-tenant planning records. `ordinary` is the class the runtime clamp
// leaves ELIGIBLE for a standing `auto` grant, so a tenant owner/authorized rep CAN grant Paige
// autonomous authority to create and revise briefs within their approved scope. Confirmation is the
// ESCALATION lane (the platform default, and where the RPC itself refuses out-of-policy changes,
// ambiguous scope, an unavailable linked record, or a version conflict) — never a blanket gate on
// every planning write. The runtime authority resolves through `resolve_tool_autonomy` +
// `classifyAction`, exactly as every other governed tool does; nothing here is a second channel.
