 * Chat's adapter onto the `social.presence` capability (see ./social.ts).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT routed through resolveSpineEvidence/mindEvidence.ts, for the same reason
 * businessContextChatEvidence.ts is not: that machinery projects Rail SIGNAL rows — a durable
 * evidence table with a citation, an outcome ref and a stored history — and
 * public.get_social_presence_evidence is a live, stateless read straight over the workspace's own
 * current record. There is no signal to resolve, and building on the Rail resolver would invent a
 * row this capability was scoped not to need.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RENDERS: for each of the six networks, whether an account is on record and the handle
 * if it is. Nothing else exists to render — a declared handle carries no audience, no performance,
 * no queue and no placement, and the block says so in words so the model cannot fill the gap.
