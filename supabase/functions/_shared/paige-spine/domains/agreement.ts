// INT-178 — AGREEMENTS, the READ half. PAIGE can see a workspace's e-signature agreements and the
// status of any one of them. Both capabilities execute the SAME governed seam,
// `public.paige_agreement_overview` (migration 20270402000000), whose own header names it "the read
// Paige answers from"; the adapter is `_shared/agreements/chat-read.ts`.
//
// WHAT THIS CORRECTS. INT-163 shipped the engine and left `registry.ts` carrying a comment that
// DRAFT, VOID and STATUS "register here". None of them did — the array held zero agreement
// capabilities, so PAIGE could not see an agreement at all. The comment described intent that was
// never delivered, and this file is the first half of delivering it.
//
// WHY ONLY THE READS ARE HERE — the same seam boundary `calendar_link.ts` documents, for the same
// reason. The Spine validator requires an action's executor to be an exact `public.<symbol>`
// present in migration history. SEND and RESEND execute the `agreement-send` EDGE FUNCTION, which
// that validator rejects, so registering them would mean widening the shared executor allowlist —
// a change to the Spine contract itself — for zero added enforcement, since what actually clamps a
// send is `_shared/action-risk.ts` plus the inline Chat confirm gate. DRAFT and VOID do have clean
// `public.*` executors (`save_paige_agreement`, `void_paige_agreement`) and are deliberately NOT
// registered here either: they are mutations, and this slice is read-first on purpose, because the
// send path has a real client on the other end of it.
//
// SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY (§13). Registering a capability does not grant one. The two READ entries
// are `read` / `read_only` / no approval authority, and the RPC they name re-proves the caller's
// tenant and membership in its own body under the caller's JWT (§59). Nothing there can read
// another workspace.
//
// THE FIRST WRITE THROUGH THIS BOUNDARY (2026-09-24) — `agreement.draft`, and only that one. The
// read-first reasoning above is unchanged and still governs: the send path has a real client on the
// other end of it, so each outward-facing key earns its own slice. A draft is the opposite — it is
// visible to nobody outside the workspace, mints no signing link, and sends nothing.
//
// WHAT THE `defineCapability()` DECLARATION BELOW IS, AND IS NOT. It is the FIRST production
// declaration in this repository; every other mutating chat tool predates the kit and is
// grandfathered in `capability-kit-bypass-baseline.json`. Stated plainly because the word
// "governed" would otherwise be read as more than it is: NOTHING consumes a `DefinedCapability` at
// runtime — no registry, no resolver, no dispatch reads it. Its only runtime behaviour is to THROW
// on import if its declared risk contradicts the canonical policy, which is exactly the false-green
// `action-risk.ts` warns about (a mismatch passes `capability-kit-lint`, which never reads
// `governance.risk`, and fails at the first cold start). What actually clamps this write is
// `action-risk.ts` + the inline Chat confirm gate + the RPC's own tenant and membership checks.

/**
 * THE GOVERNED DECLARATION FOR `agreement_draft` — the first production `defineCapability()` in
 * this repository. `action-risk.ts` states the contract it satisfies: "classify it here, declare
 * it through defineCapability(), and ship its tool schema — in the same change."
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE, BESIDE THE TOOL IT DESCRIBES, AND IT MUST BE IMPORTED TO MEAN ANYTHING. This
 * module is already imported by `paige-ai-chat/index.ts`, so the declaration is EVALUATED on every
 * cold start. That matters more than it looks: the only runtime behaviour a declaration has is to
 * THROW when its declared risk contradicts the canonical policy, and a declaration sitting in a
 * module nothing imports would clear CI and never run the check it exists for.
 *
 * `governance.risk` must equal `classifyAction("agreement_draft")` exactly, and `governance.approval`
 * is forced by the same tuple. `capability-kit-lint` reads `actionRiskKey` and never `risk`, so a
 * contradiction here passes CI and fails at the first cold start — which is precisely the
 * false-green `action-risk.ts` records. Changing the class in one place means changing it in both.

/**
 * `agreement_send` — the governed declaration for the one agreement action that reaches outside the
 * workspace. Same contract as the draft above, with two differences that both follow from that:
 *
 *   `effect: "external_effect"` — the kit forces `risk: "high"` for this effect, which is the point.
 *   `providerBinding.operation` names an EDGE FUNCTION rather than an RPC. The kind stays
 *     `"internal"`: the kit's three kinds are internal / mcp / partner, and an edge function of ours
 *     is our own infrastructure, not a third party. (`"edge"` is not a kind — I tried it, and the
 *     constructor refused it at import, which is the behaviour this declaration exists for.)
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A SpineCapability. The Spine validator requires an executor to be an exact
 * `public.<symbol>` present in migration history, and widening that allowlist for an edge function
 * is a change to the Spine contract itself — for no added enforcement, since what actually clamps a
 * send is `action-risk.ts` plus the Chat confirm gate plus the function's own admin check. That is
 * the same boundary `calendar_link_send` sits on, and it is drawn deliberately rather than skipped.
