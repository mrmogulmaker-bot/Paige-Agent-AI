/**
 * Integrations surface — Paige's visibility into what's connected, what's
 * available, and what's healthy (#1140 follow-on; the owner's capability
 * mandate: "Paige and her agents need to read, write, create").
 *
 * This first wave is READ verbs — the 80% of integration questions owners
 * actually ask: "what am I connected to?", "is my email working?", "what
 * else can I connect?". The write verbs (connect/disconnect/configure)
 * involve OAuth flows and provider-specific logic — a deliberate later wave.
 *
 * The adapter (public.list_integration_surface) reads from channel_connectors
 * (the live connection state) joined against the Integration Capability
 * Registry's provider catalogue, so the answer is always the tenant's REAL
 * state, never a cached or guessed one.
