/**
 * THE PAIGE CAPABILITY GATEWAY — what Chat is even allowed to reach, decided from the truth.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SITS IN THE GRAND DESIGN
 * -----------------------------------
 *   domains own capabilities
 *     → the Spine declares each one's governed contract (registry.ts + contracts.ts)
 *       → the capability-status resolver says what is true for THIS tenant right now
 *         → **this gateway exposes only the admissible capabilities to Chat**
 *           → Chat selects a governed action / draft / question / explanation
 *             → the domain tool/RPC runs through the shared seam (decideGovernedExecution)
 *               → canonical write/provider → fresh readback → receipt + Rail → truthful result
 *
 * So the gateway is the ADMISSIBILITY step, and only that. It decides, per registered capability,
 * what Chat may do with it — hand the model an executable tool, route it through an approval card,
 * explain a setup step, explain why it is unavailable, or expose nothing at all. It does NOT decide
 * whether a given invocation actually runs: that re-resolves at execution through
 * `decideGovernedExecution`, which now carries the SAME capability status this module reads
 * (`GovernedCapability.availability`), so a capability this gateway hides cannot be reached through
 * another door either. Admissibility here; the governed decision there; neither replaces the other.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT (§00). It has no opinion about how Chat LOOKS or reads. It emits tool definitions
 * and a machine-readable disposition; presentation is the frontend's. And it invents no capability:
 * every entry it can emit traces to a registered Spine capability or to the gateway's own discovery
 * verb, never to a hopeful string.
 *
 * WHY THE CORE IS PURE. `decideGatewayEntry` takes resolved facts and returns a disposition with no
 * I/O, so the whole admissibility matrix is a unit test rather than an integration ceremony — the
 * same discipline as the resolver it composes with and the seam it feeds.

 * honest unavailable explanation, or nothing.
 *
 *   tool                 — executable now. The model may call it; the shared seam does the rest.
 *   approval_card        — exposed, but a mutation that is drafted and routed through approval
 *                          (the workspace lane is confirm/off). The model may invoke it; the seam
 *                          returns `propose` and Chat renders the approval, rather than executing.
 *   setup_explanation    — NOT executable. A connection/setup step is required first; Paige explains
 *                          it instead of handing the model a tool that would only fail.
 *   planned_explanation  — NOT executable. A real capability that is not built yet; Paige says so.
 *   tier_explanation     — NOT executable. Not available for this account type.
 *   unavailable          — NOT executable. Cannot be confirmed for this workspace, so Paige must
 *                          not claim it (§13/§947).
 *   none                 — nothing to expose: the capability has no Chat verb at all.

 * owes per-tier authenticated verification, so it is the next increment, not a silent behaviour
 * change folded into this one (§13).
