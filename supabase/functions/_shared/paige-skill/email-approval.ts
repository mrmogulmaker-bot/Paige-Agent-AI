/**
 * THE EXTERNAL-SEND APPROVAL FOR `draft_and_email_document` — durable, single-use, and bound to the
 * EXACT thing a person approved.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN GATE, ABOVE THE GENERIC GOVERNED GATE. `draft_and_email_document` is the one
 * skill in `skill-runner` with an EXTERNAL SEND (a Resend email into a real person's inbox). The
 * generic governed decision (`decideSkillRun`) refuses the cases that must never reach here at all —
 * an unauthenticated caller, a request-supplied tenant, a service principal acting alone, a caller
 * the surface did not authorize. What it cannot do is bind a human's "yes" to the EXACT send, so that
 * a direct caller cannot (a) forge a confirmation, or (b) reuse one approval to email a DIFFERENT
 * recipient, a DIFFERENT document, or from a DIFFERENT sender. That binding is what this module adds,
 * and it reuses the canonical `paige_pending_confirmations` table + the `confirm-fingerprint.ts`
 * pattern rather than inventing a parallel approval system (§18).
 *
 * THE TWO PHASES, AND WHY THE DRAFT IS STORED RATHER THAN RE-AUTHORED.
 *   - Phase 1 (no approval submitted): resolve the sender, DRAFT the document, fingerprint the EXACT
 *     send — `(action, tenant, contact, recipient, sender identity, doc_type, content hash)` — and
 *     record a single-use proposal holding the drafted content. Nothing is sent. The caller is handed
 *     the fingerprint + a human-readable summary.
 *   - Phase 2 (approval submitted): CLAIM the proposal atomically (a compare-and-set on `consumed_at`),
 *     and send the STORED content to the STORED recipient under the STORED sender — the exact thing the
 *     fingerprint was bound to. The model/caller never re-authors the call, so it cannot drift the
 *     recipient, the body, or the sender between approval and send (the same reason the chat gate
 *     executes stored arguments, 20261023000000).
 *
 * SINGLE USE IS ENFORCED BY THE WRITE, NOT BY TRUST. The claim sets `consumed_at` in the same UPDATE
 * that reads the row, so a replay of the same fingerprint after consumption matches nothing and is
 * DENIED. An expired, forged, cross-tenant, or wrong-person token matches nothing for the same reason.
 * On EVERY denied path nothing is sent and no receipt is written.
 *
 * PURE + DEPENDENCY-INJECTED, exactly like `resolveSecureBrowserAuthority`, so the whole matrix —
 * same-tenant success, cross-tenant denial, forged/expired/replayed denial, and "no send on any
 * denied path" — is provable from `src/**` vitest without a Deno runtime, a database, or Resend.
