// Paige Runtime Harness — Layer C · C4: the ONE canonical home for the per-act outcome vocabulary and the
// FINAL/SETTLED state set (§18 — one home per capability).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The "exact state semantics" the owner requires (MESSAGE B item 3) were, until C4,
// duplicated across FOUR hand-maintained copies with no drift guard between them:
//   1. decide.ts `ActOutcome` — the TS outcome union.
//   2. the SQL domain `public.paige_act_outcome` CHECK (migration 20270126000000).
//   3. engine.ts `FINAL_OR_SETTLED` — the TS "a final row is never re-dispatched" set.
//   4. the SQL `_final` array inside `paige_record_act_execution` (same migration).
// A drift between (1)/(2) or (3)/(4) is a SILENT correctness bug of exactly the class C4 names: if a state is
// FINAL in the RPC but advanceable in the engine, phase 5 reconciles a row the RPC refuses to update (a
// phantom "still reconciling" that can never settle); if it is advanceable in the RPC but FINAL in the engine,
// the engine treats a genuinely in-flight row as done and drops the reconcile.
//
// C4 collapses the TS side to ONE definition here; `decide.ts` and `engine.ts` DERIVE from it. The SQL side
// stays authoritative in its already-shipped migration (never re-written — it is live on prod), and a
// BIDIRECTIONAL drift guard (paige-orchestration-decide.test.ts) parses that migration and asserts the SQL
// domain == ACT_OUTCOMES and the SQL `_final` == FINAL_OUTCOMES, set-for-set, both directions. That mechanical
// pin is the same pattern as the F5 registry-sync guard — a two-source invariant locked by a test, not by a
// human remembering to edit two files (§13/§32). If the SQL domain or `_final` set is ever changed by a NEW
// migration, this canonical TS + the guard move with it in the SAME commit (§66/§BRAIN.3).
//
// PURE by construction — no I/O, no imports, so any adapter, the engine, the decision core, and the tests all
// share ONE vocabulary without a dependency cycle.
