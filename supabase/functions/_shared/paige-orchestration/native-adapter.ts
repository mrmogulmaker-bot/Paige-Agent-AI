// Paige Runtime Harness — Layer C · C2: the NATIVE synchronous executor(s).
//
// A "native" action is one whose effect is a governed IN-TENANT Paige write with a canonical RPC — no
// external provider, no per-tenant connection/consent to negotiate. C2 ships exactly ONE: advancing a
// contact's journey stage (`crm.advance_journey_stage` action_kind → the tenant-aware `set_journey_stage`
// RPC). The native ActionAdapter (registered in adapters.ts) routes an action_kind to its executor here, so
// adding the next native action is one registry entry — never a journey-specific engine (owner:
// connector-neutral).
//
// The contract this honours (adapters.ts): dispatch performs the effect and RETURNS THE TERMINAL OUTCOME
// for a synchronous action (executed | failed | ambiguous); readback is the standalone CORRELATION reconcile
// (exposed for the contract and unit-testing; dispatch calls the same helper inline after a change).
//
// HONESTY & SAFETY invariants (§13/§32 + owner C2 corrections, 2026-09-13):
//   * executed is returned ONLY after OUR OWN write is CONFIRMED to have landed — proven by a transition row
//     the RPC stamped with THIS act's correlation ref (§32). A write's own "ok" is never proof by itself.
//   * confirmation is BY CORRELATION, NOT by the contact's current slug. A bare "current slug == target"
//     check false-confirms when a CONCURRENT act moved the contact to the same stage under a different
//     correlation — OUR write may never have landed. Only a transition stamped with OUR correlationRef
//     proves OUR act's effect, independent of any later concurrent move (§39 F3).
//   * a no-op (already on target) IS the confirmed desired state → executed, reported HONESTLY as
//     `already_at_requested_stage` (NEVER a newly advanced journey). No transition row is written (idempotent).
//   * a definitive RPC RAISE (unknown stage/contact, cross-tenant, unauthorized) is a TERMINAL `failed`.
//   * a transport/throw (we cannot know whether the txn committed) is `ambiguous` — reconciled by the act's
//     own correlation ref against the transition log, NEVER blind-resent. The monotonic ledger RPC allows a
//     later ambiguous→executed reconcile; a blind retry that double-advanced a journey is what this avoids.
//   * the subject is the EVENT's subject (a `clients` row); the contact id is never taken from the args.
//     The target stage slug comes from the governed args and is used only to DRIVE the write; a
//     missing/blank slug fails closed on dispatch. The readback needs NO slug — it reconciles by correlation
//     alone, so a crash-recovery drain (which no longer holds the governed args) still confirms honestly (§39 F4).
