// Paige Runtime Harness — Layer C: the CONNECTOR-NEUTRAL action-adapter contract + registry.
//
// An act (`paige_automation_acts`) names an `action_kind`. The engine resolves it to (a) an adapter KIND
// (which governed connector carries it) and (b) the governed CAPABILITY it must be decided as — then
// governs EVERY kind through the one `decideGovernedExecution` pathway, and (slice 2) dispatches through
// the adapter and reads the outcome back. n8n is the FIRST adapter; Zapier · Make · Google · M365/Teams ·
// Slack · Telegram · direct-CRM · native-Paige · specialist-job all plug in by REGISTERING an adapter —
// the engine, the ledger, and the governed pathway never change (owner directive: connector-neutral, "do
// not build an n8n-specific engine or a second action/receipt system").
//
// This file is the PURE contract + registry + kind/capability resolution — unit-provable. The actual
// dispatch/readback is implemented PER ADAPTER (a native adapter's I/O is dependency-injected via
// DispatchInput.db, so this module imports no client and stays testable). C2 implements the NATIVE adapter
// (native-adapter.ts — the synchronous in-tenant executor). n8n's dispatch/readback land in C3 (reusing
// paige-n8n's run/execution_get via a shared seam — never a forked n8n client), still contract-stable here.
