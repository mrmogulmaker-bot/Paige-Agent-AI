// Paige Runtime Harness — Layer C · C5: the APPROVAL-EXECUTOR.
//
// A Layer-C act a human must confirm lands at `approval_pending` in `paige_act_executions` (engine.ts).
// Until C5 it dead-ended. This module is the seam that, on a human's approval, drives that held act to
// execution — WITHOUT a new engine and WITHOUT weakening the C4 monotonic contract:
//
//   1. re-resolve the capability's availability THROUGH the canonical Gateway (never cached, §C2 correction),
//   2. re-run the ONE governed pathway (`decideGovernedExecution`) with the human's yes expressed as the
//      approval claim (`claimedArgs` = the act's IMMUTABLE governed args, `claimedFor` = the capability id) → `execute`,
//   3. atomically REDEEM the approval via the dedicated `paige_approve_act_execution` RPC
//      (approval_pending → accepted_for_execution — the single sanctioned transition; idempotent),
//   4. DISPATCH through the already-registered ActionAdapter (native this slice) and read the outcome back,
//   5. advance the ledger accepted→executed|failed|ambiguous via the monotonic `paige_record_act_execution`,
//      and on a CONFIRMED executed file the capability receipt + owner Rail (Rail suppressed on an idempotent
//      no-op) — the same evidence engine.ts phase-5 files.
//
// IMMUTABLE ARGS (§P1, Codex peer-gate). The args + action_kind dispatched are read from the LEDGER ROW's own
// snapshot (`detail.snapshot_args`, captured by the engine when the act landed approval_pending; `capability_key`
// is the ledger's own action-kind snapshot) — NEVER the live `paige_automation_acts.config`, which a tenant admin
// can mutate between the hold and the approval. So approval executes exactly what the reviewer saw (§70.2).
//
// RESUMABLE / RECOVERABLE (§P3/§P4, Codex peer-gate + §13/§32). This seam accepts three inbound ledger states so
// a half-completed prior attempt is RECOVERABLE rather than stranded:
//   * approval_pending          → FRESH: availability → governed execute → redeem → dispatch → advance.
//   * accepted_for_execution    → RESUME: a prior attempt redeemed but its ledger-advance never persisted (a
//                                  write blip). Reconcile by correlation; if it LANDED, adopt it (ungated). If
//                                  it never landed, re-dispatch — but ONLY after the §68 gate (slice 2) re-
//                                  confirms availability + governed authority, so authority revoked AFTER
//                                  redemption declines to re-fire rather than firing blind.
//   * ambiguous                 → RESUME: an unconfirmed prior dispatch. Reconcile by correlation ONLY —
//                                  NEVER a blind re-dispatch (owner rule, engine phase-5). Still unconfirmed →
//                                  report, consume NOTHING (the caller keeps the approval reclaimable); the
//                                  durable reconciler (paige_reconcile_orchestration_acts) sweeps it to a
//                                  terminal state so an orphan whose event already completed never loops silently.
// The caller (execute-approval) consumes the approval (stamps `approved`) ONLY for a terminal, durably-recorded
// outcome (executed | failed). ambiguous / accepted_for_execution / a governed refusal / a read blip consume
// NOTHING, so a re-approval re-enters here and reconciles.
//
// SCOPE (slice 1, §13): NATIVE acts only (the shipped `crm.advance_journey_stage`). An n8n-sourced held act
// is reported `not_supported_in_slice` and NEVER fired — the engine does not drive n8n dispatch yet (C3+),
// so approving one to real execution is later async work, not this seam.
//
// AUTHORITY (§9/§59): this module is called by `execute-approval` AFTER it has verified the JWT approver
// (admin/coach + active member of the act's tenant, or platform owner). The approver id is threaded here for
// the governed `principal:"person"` attribution (a `service` principal may not mutate — governedExecution.ts)
// and for the audit stamp on the approve RPC. The tenant is the AUTHORITATIVE one from the ledger row / event,
// never a request body.
//
// HONESTY (§13/§32): `executed` is returned ONLY after the adapter confirms (native reconciles by correlation,
// never a bare "ok"); a redemption that finds a terminal row STOPS and reports the persisted truth rather than
// re-dispatching; a definitive failure is terminal `failed`; an unconfirmable outcome is `ambiguous` (never a
// blind re-fire); a ledger-write failure after a real dispatch reports the PRIOR persisted state (never the
// adapter outcome), so the caller cannot record an outcome the ledger never persisted. Nothing here claims an
// act ran that only queued.
