// Paige Runtime Harness — Layer C: INDEPENDENT event-integrity check (owner correction #2, 2026-09-13).
//
// The native-event dispatcher already takes the tenant from the CLAIMED event row, never a request body
// (§9). This is a second, independent line: it re-derives the tenant from the canonical SUBJECT record the
// event points at (`subject_table` + `subject_id`) and asserts it equals the tenant the event row claims.
//
// WHY. The event row's `tenant_id` is written by a producer (a trigger, a sweeper). If a producer ever wrote
// a subject whose real owner differs from the tenant it stamped — a bug, a mis-wired future producer, a
// poisoned insert — the dispatcher would otherwise run governed acts under the WRONG tenant. This check makes
// that unrunnable: on any mismatch, missing subject, or unrecognised subject table it FAILS CLOSED, and the
// dispatcher records the truthful failure and makes NO authority, adapter, or provider decision.
//
// The read is intentionally UNSCOPED (the service-role drainer bypasses RLS) — reading the subject's ACTUAL
// tenant is the whole point of an independent check; scoping the read to the claimed tenant would only prove
// the claim against itself.

/** The minimal supabase-js surface this needs — keeps it unit-provable without importing the SDK type. */
