// Shared SSRF guard + hardened outbound transport for any edge function that fetches a
// caller/tenant-supplied URL (outbound webhooks, connected-app endpoints, MCP servers, …).
//
// String matching alone is bypassable (IPv4-mapped IPv6, DNS → internal, link-local),
// so we resolve the host and validate EVERY resolved IP numerically against
// private/loopback/link-local/ULA/carrier-grade-NAT/mapped ranges. IP literals are
// validated directly.
//
// This file is the ONE home (§18). The same numeric validator was independently forked
// inline into paige-n8n and call-zapier-action; new callers use `safeFetch` here rather
// than copying it a fifth time.
//
// `safeFetch` closes the three gaps every fork shares — credentials in the URL, an
// unbounded wait, and an unbounded response body — and refuses redirects outright
// instead of trying to re-validate each hop, which is the stricter of the two postures:
// a hop is never followed, so a hop is never validated, and a redirect chain cannot walk
// an approved host into an internal one.
//
// RESIDUAL RISK, stated rather than implied: this guard resolves the host and then hands
// the URL to `fetch`, which resolves it AGAIN. Between those two resolutions a name can
// change what it points at, and this validated the first answer while the socket used the
// second. Closing it needs the connection pinned to the IP that was checked, and Deno's
// `fetch` exposes no way to do that — there is no per-request resolver hook and no
// connect-time callback. So the window is real and is NOT closed here.
//
// What bounds it: a short TTL is not enough on its own, but an attacker also has to win
// the race on a host the workspace's own admin configured, and every fetch through here
// is already refused a redirect, refused a non-HTTPS scheme, and capped in time and size.
// Do not read the checks below as proving the connected address is safe; read them as
// proving the CONFIGURED address is, which is the property the product actually needs.
// If a pinned-IP transport becomes available, this is the first place it belongs.
