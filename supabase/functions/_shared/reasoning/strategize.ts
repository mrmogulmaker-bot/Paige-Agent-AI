// _shared/reasoning/strategize.ts — §34 Layer 4, PHASE 1: Strategic Pre-Reasoning.
//
// Before Paige generates anything substantive, she THINKS about HOW first — the opposite of firing a
// raw prompt at a model and hoping (§26). This is the "measure twice" step: given a task brief, it
//   (a) recalls what worked for THIS tenant before (recallSimilar — the §14 "get smarter from constant
//       data" loop: past approved wins become few-shot anchors), and
//   (b) makes ONE frontier reasoning call to produce a STRATEGY — decompose the task, pick an approach,
//       name the risks, and state the success criteria the downstream generation/verifier will be held to.
//
// It sits beside the Phase-4 bounded loop (engine.ts) and the trace/learning seam (trace.ts) as one home
// (§18). It does NOT clone the prompt-forge: the forge assembles the GENERATION prompt from brand DNA;
// this decides the PLAN the generation should follow. Different jobs, composed later in the pipeline.
//
// HONEST-DEGRADE CONTRACT (§13): pre-reasoning is an ENHANCEMENT. It must NEVER throw into, block, or
// break the actual generation the caller asked for. Every failure path (no tenant, recall miss, LLM
// error, unparseable reply) returns a `degraded` strategy and the caller proceeds exactly as it would
// have without this step.
//
// §17: the reasoning call is `routedChatCompletion("plan", …)` — "plan" is a reasoning JobKind that
// routes to Claude's reasoning tier and can NEVER route to an open model. That call ALSO writes its own
// paige_llm_trace row (L1.1), so this module wires NO second trace (no double-count) — it just threads
// the correlation ctx onto routedChatCompletion's `trace` param.
//
// §34: pure in-repo (model-router + prompt-forge). No vendor reasoning SDK.
