 * The roster's rule: a VP address routes the ONE Paige Harness to that VP's
 * capability domain with eligible scoped context — it does NOT create a separate
 * runtime, memory, or authority. This module is the presentation layer of that
 * rule: it detects the address and produces an additive system block (voice +
 * scope) for the turn. The persona block still leads; authority still resolves
 * through the Spine at execution time; nothing here grants anything.
 *
 * The six VPs are doctrine-locked (roster amendment required to change this list).
 * Dependency-free (no `npm:` / Deno globals) so vitest imports it directly.
