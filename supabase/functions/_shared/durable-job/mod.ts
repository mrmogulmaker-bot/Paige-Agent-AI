/**
 * Paige Durable Job Contract — shared seam module.
 *
 * Implements `docs/brain/paige-durable-job-contract.md` (PROPOSAL adopted 2026-09-10),
 * which extends the Paige Runtime Harness doctrine in
 * `docs/PAIGE-MASTER-PROJECT-REFERENCE.md` §3 responsibility #5 (durable work).
 *
 * TWO-LAYER RULE. This module governs machine execution ATTEMPTS, never business
 * workflow. A business row (e.g. `paige_actions.status`) keeps its own lifecycle; it
 * rides this contract only through its execution attempts. Nothing here replaces or
 * renames a business lifecycle.
 *
 * SCOPE OF MECHANICS. The seam owns canonical states, lease math, idempotency-window
 * math, and receipt correlation. It intentionally owns NO table and NO claim SQL of its
 * own: each substrate keeps its schema (the comms drainer's `claim_due_scheduled_messages`
 * is the in-repo model — FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED + service-role-only grant) and adopts
 * these semantics through a per-substrate claim RPC and adapter.
 *
 * HONEST STATES (CLAUDE.md §13). `succeeded` requires a verified canonical write. A
 * lost lease is `expired`, which routes to reconciliation — never blind retry. An
 * ambiguous effect is `outcome_unknown` and MUST reconcile before any retry. "Done" is
 * never claimed from a hope.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-free (no `npm:` / Deno globals) so vitest can
 * import it directly, the same way `_shared/paige-spine/registry.ts` is exercised.
 */
