// _shared/mcp-outcome.ts — the boundary between a provider's answer and Paige.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// `paige-ai-chat` serialises a tool result straight into the model's context. An MCP
// server is tenant-configured and provider-operated, so its response is UNTRUSTED INPUT
// on three axes at once: it can carry instructions aimed at the model, it can carry
// credentials, and it can carry another tenant's records. Forwarding it — however the
// forwarding is framed — puts all three in front of Paige.
//
// WHY THE SUMMARY DESCRIBES SHAPE AND NOT CONTENT
//
// The obvious design is a short, redacted excerpt of what the provider said. That does not
// hold. Redaction can catch things that LOOK like secrets; it cannot catch
// "IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS", and it cannot catch another tenant's customer name,
// because neither has a shape to match on. Any design that forwards provider prose is one
// unmatched pattern away from forwarding an instruction or a record.
//
// So no provider text crosses this boundary at all. What Paige receives is what she
// actually needs in order to act: which capability ran, whether it worked, when, whether
// it was authorised, and an opaque reference under which the detail is held. The detail
// itself stays server-side, encrypted, and tenant-scoped.
//
// WHY IT FAILS CLOSED ON THE CAPABILITY
//
// A capability that the workspace has not approved is not called. The check happens before
// any request leaves the process, so an unapproved name cannot even be used to probe the
// provider. An empty approval set therefore denies everything, which is the correct state
// for a workspace that has not yet approved anything.

/* ── Provenance: the Action Bus and the Rail ────────────────────────────────────
   The last leg of the governed path. A capability that ran has to leave a record the
   organisation can read, and that record is subject to the same boundary as everything
   else: it carries what happened, never what the provider said.

   Both writers already exist and are used as they are (§18). `file_action` is the only
   writer of `paige_actions`; `record_rail_event` is the only writer of the rail. Neither
   is wrapped, forked or replaced here — this composes them. */

 * WHAT IS RECORDED WHERE, AND WHY THEY DIFFER
 *
 * The Action Bus is tenant-scoped and its contact is optional, so every call is filed
 * there — including the refusals, which are the ones worth being able to find later.
 *
 * The Rail is contact-scoped by construction: `paige_client_events.contact_id` is NOT NULL
 * and references `clients`, and `record_rail_event` refuses a contact that is not in the
 * tenant. A capability run that is not about a particular client therefore has no place on
 * it, and inventing a contact to satisfy the column would put a fabricated association in
 * front of an operator. So the rail entry is written only when the turn genuinely has a
 * contact in scope, and its absence is reported rather than worked around.
 *
 * Never throws. Provenance failing must not turn a completed action into a reported
 * failure — the action happened, and saying otherwise would be the lie this whole path is
 * built to avoid. Failures are logged and reported in the return value.
