// call-zapier-action — per-tenant Zapier/MCP action caller (Wave 1 #240, Track B slice B2).
//
// Calls a Zapier MCP action (Streamable HTTP MCP JSON-RPC tools/call) using the
// CALLER'S OWN tenant credentials — the per-tenant replacement for the shared
// ZAPIER_MCP_TOKEN env var + platform-global paige_mcp_connections row.
//
// Body (two shapes):
//   { tool_name: string, arguments?: object }  → run one action (MCP tools/call)
//   { action: "list" }                         → discover enabled actions (MCP tools/list)
//   (legacy `connection_id` is accepted-but-ignored — see §37 note below.)
//   The `action` field is ADDITIVE (§37): existing {tool_name} callers are unaffected.
//
// Security (§9 tenant isolation):
//  • The caller's JWT authenticates them; admin-gated (has_role admin).
//  • The tenant is derived SERVER-SIDE from the JWT (current_user_tenant_id, run in
//    the caller's JWT context) — a client-supplied tenant_id is NEVER trusted for the
//    secret read. Mirrors the proven paige-n8n pattern.
//  • The MCP server URL + bearer token are decrypted server-side ONLY, via the
//    service-role-only get_tenant_mcp_secret RPC. They never touch the browser and
//    are read only for the caller's OWN resolved tenant, never an arbitrary one.
//  • The tenant-supplied MCP server_url is SSRF-guarded via the shared client: https
//    only, no credentials embedded in the URL, numeric validation of every resolved
//    address, redirects refused rather than followed, and a bounded wall clock and
//    response size — so a tenant admin can't point it at an internal target, DNS-rebind
//    onto one, or hold a worker open (§13).
//  • If the tenant has no configured/enabled connection → an honest structured
//    "not_connected" response (§13); NEVER a fallback to the shared env token.
//
// THE EGRESS BOUNDARY. This function's response is serialised into a model's context by
// `paige-ai-chat`. A provider's answer is therefore UNTRUSTED INPUT reaching Paige: it can
// carry instructions aimed at her, credentials, or another tenant's records. So no
// provider payload, prose, schema or error text is returned from here. What is returned is
// the outcome projection from `_shared/mcp-outcome.ts` — which capability ran, whether it
// worked, when, whether it was authorised, and an opaque reference under which the detail
// is held encrypted and tenant-scoped.
//
// AND IT FAILS CLOSED. A capability the workspace has not approved is not called at all.
// A connection proves reachability; `approved_capabilities` is the separate authorisation
// decision, and it is empty until somebody makes it.
