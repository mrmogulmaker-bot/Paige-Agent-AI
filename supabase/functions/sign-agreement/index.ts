// sign-agreement — the token-gated signing act (INT-163). `verify_jwt = false`.
//
// WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. The signer's surface is the owner-approved React route
// `/sign/:token`, built and browser-verified by the UI lane and FROZEN under §28. This function
// serves NO markup. It does the work that genuinely needs elevated credentials and cannot happen in
// the page or in a database function: producing the signed PDF, sealing it, writing the audit trail,
// and sending notifications.
//
// The page's other calls are RPCs — `peek_agreement_signing` and `decline_agreement_signing` — so
// this endpoint exists for exactly the one act that needs pdf-lib and the service role.
//
// THE ONE RULE, unchanged from the rest of the engine: tenant, agreement and signer are read FROM
// THE TOKEN ROW. No request field names or steers any of them. That is the deliberate inverse of
// `docusign-send-envelope`, which resolves a body-supplied contact id with the service-role client
// and no tenant filter.
//
// SUCCESS IS UNAMBIGUOUS. `ok: true` is returned only when the signature is committed, and the page
// treats anything else as "nothing was signed" (§13). There is no optimistic path: a seal that fails
// after a committed signature returns `ok: true` with `completed: false` and says so, because the
// signature genuinely IS recorded and claiming otherwise would be its own lie.
