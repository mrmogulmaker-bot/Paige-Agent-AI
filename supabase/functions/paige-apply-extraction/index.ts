// paige-apply-extraction — the WRITE half of the document proposal seam.
//
// Owner ruling: "any profile/client update is a clear human-reviewed proposal. Never auto-write
// extracted fields." `paige-ai-chat` now stops at the proposal. This is what runs when a person
// looks at that proposal and says yes.
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING HERE: THE REQUEST CANNOT SUPPLY A VALUE.
// It supplies an upload id and a list of field KEYS. Every value written is re-read from the
// extraction this server stored when it produced the proposal. If approval carried values, the
// browser would be deciding what lands on a credit profile, and the human would be approving one
// thing while the server wrote whatever came back — which is not an approval, it is a form post
// wearing one. The key list is intersected with a CLOSED set (`APPROVABLE_KEYS`), so a key nobody
// designed cannot be applied however it is spelled in the body.
//
// §9 — the caller is authorized against the upload row itself, on their OWN JWT, before anything
// is read. The service-role client is used only AFTER that check passes, and only to call the
// owning contract.
//
// §37 — `sync-credit-report-data` is called with exactly the payload shape its four other
// producers send. That contract is untouched by this slice.
