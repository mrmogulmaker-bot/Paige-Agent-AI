//
//   1. authorize the caller and resolve their tenant FROM THE SESSION
//   2. check the email provider is configured        <- first, because a missing key discovered at
//   3. render the document ONCE                          step 6 leaves an agreement stuck in `sent`
//   4. upload it (upsert:false), re-read, re-hash        with live tokens nobody received and no
//   5. mint one token per signer                         way back to draft
//   6. email each signer
//   7. only now: status -> sent
//
// §9 — HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE FUNCTION IT SITS BESIDE. `docusign-send-envelope` takes contact_id
// off the request body and resolves it against `clients` with the service-role client and no tenant
// filter, behind a guard that checks the tenant-blind `has_role()` over `user_roles`. Here the tenant
// comes from `current_user_tenant_id()` under the CALLER'S OWN JWT, every query is scoped to it, and
// the database re-proves each link by trigger even for the service role.
