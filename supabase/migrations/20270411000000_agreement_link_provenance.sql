-- INT-163 / #1395 — the manual link path refuses a document it cannot prove is the uploaded one.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG. `agreement-send` used to render the agreement's TEXT body to a PDF regardless of
-- where the body actually came from. An agreement whose body is an uploaded FILE has no text, so it
-- rendered and froze a BLANK page and then emailed that. PR #1398 fixed the send path: it downloads
-- the uploaded object, inspects it, and freezes those real bytes under a storage key carrying the
-- marker `presented-source-`, while a rendered text body keeps the older `presented-`.
--
-- WHY THAT FIX WAS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHY THIS MIGRATION EXISTS. Sending is not the only way a person
-- is shown a document. The owner's surface also offers "Or copy a link", and that control goes
-- nowhere near the edge function — it calls this RPC, which mints a signing token directly. The
-- function already refused to FREEZE an uploaded file itself, correctly: the database cannot read
-- storage, so it cannot hash one. But it had nothing at all to say about a row that was ALREADY
-- frozen, and every agreement frozen by the pre-fix send path is exactly that — frozen, around a
-- blank page. So after #1398 the send door refused those rows while this door went on handing out
-- links to them, and the signer opened the link to a blank document. One defect, two doors; #1398
-- closed the first one. A fix that closes one path and not its twin is not a fix.
--
-- WHY THE AFFECTED ROW CANNOT SIMPLY BE REPAIRED. `content_sha256` is write-once, enforced by
-- `enforce_agreement_seal_immutable` (20270401000000_agreements_engine_records.sql:522), and that is
-- deliberate: the column is the record of what a human being was shown. Re-freezing it would be
-- rewriting that record to cover a defect, which is the opposite of what it is for. So the only
-- honest outcome for an affected row is to refuse, say why in words the owner can act on, and name
-- the one action that does work — a new agreement built from the same file.
--
-- THE TEST IS PROVENANCE, NOT CONTENT. An earlier attempt at this re-hashed the uploaded object and
-- compared it against the frozen digest. That is a different question, and it gives the wrong answer:
-- it also refuses an intact agreement whose source file was later renamed or tidied, which is not
-- this defect and not a reason to stop a legitimate signing. What is actually being asked is "was
-- this row frozen by the fixed code", and the storage key answers it directly — the fixed path is
-- the only thing that has ever written `presented-source-`.
--
-- THE SAME RULE IS ENFORCED AT BOTH DOORS. `supabase/functions/agreement-send/index.ts:316` applies
-- this identical substring test before it will send. There is no shared home for the rule — one door
-- is plpgsql running inside the database, the other is TypeScript running in an edge function, and
-- they share no code — so it is written twice and each copy names the other. Change one, change both.

-- Re-declared in full rather than patched, because `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` has no other form.
-- The ONLY behavioural addition is the provenance refusal marked below. One incidental simplification
-- rides with it: the original read the row twice — once for `status` with a tenant filter, then again
-- for `body_source`/`body_markdown`/`content_sha256` with NO tenant filter. The second read was safe
-- only because the first had already raised on a foreign row, which is a guarantee held at a distance.
-- The two reads are now one tenant-filtered read, so the provenance columns inherit the scope
-- directly instead of depending on an earlier statement having run.

  -- ── THE NEW REFUSAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  -- Read it as: this row says its body is an uploaded file, something has already frozen a document
  -- for it, and that frozen document did not come from the code that knows how to read an uploaded
  -- file. Whatever is on file, it is not provably the thing the owner uploaded, so nobody is going
  -- to be sent a link to it. A NULL key fails the same way and for the same reason — an unlocatable
  -- frozen document is not evidence of anything.
  --
  -- THE MESSAGE DOES NOT NAME A CAUSE, and that is deliberate. The obvious sentence — "this was
  -- prepared before a defect was fixed" — is false for a row that can be built entirely AFTER the
  -- fix: a text agreement whose send froze `presented-<uuid>.pdf` and then failed every delivery
  -- stays a draft (`agreement-send/index.ts:428`), and a draft's `body_source` is still editable
  -- (`enforce_agreement_seal_immutable`, 20270401000000:544), so switching it to an upload lands
  -- exactly here. Refusing it is right — the frozen bytes are a render of the discarded text, not
  -- the new file — but blaming a historical defect for it would be a guess presented as a fact.
  -- What the predicate actually establishes is the stored document's provenance, so that is all
  -- the sentence claims.
  --
  -- This sits ahead of the signer check on purpose. A missing signer is a step on the way to
  -- sending; this is a dead end. Telling an owner to add a signer to an agreement that can never be
  -- sent walks them further down a path that ends here anyway.
