-- Assigned-staff relationships belong to exactly one tenant.
--
-- `coach_clients` records which staff member is assigned to which client. Its name predates the
-- platform's staff model; everything this migration introduces is named for what it is (an
-- assignee, a relationship) and the table itself is not renamed here.
--
-- After this migration:
--   * every relationship carries the tenant that holds the client;
--   * the client must be linked in that tenant — structurally, by a composite foreign key to
--     clients(tenant_id, linked_user_id);
--   * the assignee must qualify in that tenant (active member, or a manager of it through its
--     agency) — validated on every write by a trigger, because membership is not a key;
--   * losing that standing suspends the relationship and regaining it restores it, so nobody loses
--     assignments across a suspension (every dependent policy honours status = 'active');
--   * relationships are written only by the assignment path, never directly by a signed-in user;
--   * the helper's assignment branch and the invitations policy apply the same tenant rule.

-- Step 0: abort if the starting state is not the one this migration was written against.
