-- business_context.readiness contract: the grant surface, the two caller paths, the role gate,
-- the always-four-rows honesty invariant, and that no raw value ever crosses.
-- Synthetic fixtures; always rolled back.
--
-- The role gate is the reason this file exists in CI rather than only as a local proof. The first
-- draft of get_business_context_readiness had NO role gate: a workspace's own CLIENT is an
-- authenticated user of that same tenant, so current_user_tenant_id() resolved happily and handed
-- them their coach's setup readiness — while the capability declared audience: owner_internal. A
-- local proof that only tested cross-TENANT isolation passed the whole time. These assertions test
-- the role axis explicitly so that class cannot come back silently.

-- Antonio Daniel LLC and First Sterling Capital.
--
-- WITHOUT the correction these assertions fail, and they fail for the right reason: the old
-- get_business_context_readiness returned `needs_confirmation` for website and business_phone
-- ("there is no value") while tenant_comms_readiness returned has_website/has_phone = true ("there
-- is a value"), about the same workspace, in the same second. The FINAL assertion below states
-- that disagreement directly as an invariant over both readers, so a regression to either reader's
-- old shape breaks CI rather than waiting to be noticed on someone's screen.
