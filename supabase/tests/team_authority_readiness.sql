-- team.authority contract: the grant surface, the JWT-only caller path, the active-seat gate,
-- the always-two-rows honesty invariant, and — the reason this file exists rather than a local
-- proof — that the two facts stay SEPARATE and each comes from its own canonical source.
-- Synthetic fixtures; always rolled back.
--
-- The load-bearing fixture is `bcr-split`: a user who is the legal OWNER of workspace B while
-- holding a plain MEMBER seat in workspace A, which is their ACTIVE workspace. That one row is what
-- makes two otherwise-invisible regressions loud:
--
--   1. is_tenant_owner(uid) instead of is_tenant_owner(uid, tenant). The second parameter defaults
--      to NULL and the body then means "owner of ANY workspace". Measured against this fixture on
--      production 2026-09-03: the correct form returns false, the one-argument form returns TRUE.
--      Five real workspaces would report a non-owner as owner today.
--   2. Collapsing permission and ownership the way get_paige_team_context() does
--      (is_owner OR role = 'owner'). Under this fixture the caller's role is 'member' and their
--      ownership is false, so a collapse cannot hide behind them agreeing — which they do for all
--      13 real members on production, and which is exactly why a proof built only on real-shaped
--      data would pass while the defect shipped.
