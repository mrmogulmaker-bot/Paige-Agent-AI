-- list_integration_surface: Paige can SEE her MCP connections, and the list does not lie.
-- Synthetic fixtures; always rolled back.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before 20270410214500, list_integration_surface read only
-- public.channel_connectors, so every MCP connection a tenant owned was invisible to Paige —
-- absent, not stale. Asked "am I connected to Zapier?" she had nothing to answer from.
--
-- The dangerous half of the fix is the one these assertions target. The gateway registry
-- (public.mcp_connections) was filled by a ONE-TIME backfill with no trigger keeping it current,
-- while the legacy writers remain the live write path. So reading the gateway ALONE would hand
-- Paige a list with a hole in it — and a hole in a list is indistinguishable from an absence, which
-- turns honest silence into a confident false "no, you aren't connected." (C) is that invariant.
--
-- (D) is the §9 crown jewel: list_integration_surface is SECURITY DEFINER and so bypasses RLS on a
-- table whose only policy is is_platform_owner(). The owner_only visibility gate therefore has to
-- survive being reached through a nested definer call. It does, because SECURITY DEFINER changes
-- the executing privilege and NOT auth.uid() — but that is the kind of claim that must be proven
-- rather than reasoned about, so it is proven here, from both sides.
--
-- Run: psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/tests/integrations_surface_sees_mcp.sql "$DB_URL"
