/**
 * ─── THE OPERATOR CHAT, WIRED TO THE ENGINE THAT ALREADY EXISTS (§18) ────────────────────────
 *
 * The defect this closes, found 2026-08-24 against the owner's side-by-side: the spine is a
 * fully-ported chat surface with NOTHING behind it. `OperatorSpine` takes `transcript` and
 * `onSend` as props and — correctly, per its own docblock — refuses to own an engine:
 *
 *   "NOT PORTED (§18, deliberately): any chat engine. The platform already has one. Nothing here
 *    stores a thread, sends a message, streams a token or calls a model."
 *
 * That was the right call and it was never finished. Nothing in `src/operator/` passed either
 * prop, so the operator could type into a live-looking composer and nothing happened — a control
 * that looks live and silently does nothing is the exact §13/§36 failure the doctrine names.
 *
 * This is the missing half: the caller. It does NOT reimplement the engine — it POSTs the same
 * `paige-ai-chat` seam the app and Studio chats already use, with the operator's own JWT.
 *
 * WHY THE OPERATOR PERSONA NEEDS NO ARGUMENT HERE (§52). `paige-ai-chat` composes the operator
 * briefing SERVER-side, gated on `is_platform_operator()` derived from the verified JWT — never
 * from anything a caller sends. So passing the operator's token is the whole of it: she opens
 * already briefed, and a tenant token through this same seam gets the tenant persona instead. A
 * client-supplied "I am the operator" flag would be a §588 hole; there is deliberately none.
 *
 * ─── THE APPROVAL PLATE (2026-09-24) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Paige's autonomy gate refuses to run a mutating action until the person approves the EXACT
 * call, and it proves which call by issuing a fingerprint the surface must echo back. Until now
 * this surface dropped those frames on the floor: the SSE loop read only
 * `choices[0].delta.content`, so a `paige_confirm` frame — valid JSON with no `choices` — became
 * `undefined` and fell out of the loop. Not caught, not logged, just gone.
 *
 * The consequence was worse than a missing card. For an action the risk policy classes `high`,
 * the server REFUSES the model's own "they said yes" channel outright and tells it to point the
 * operator at "the Needs your OK card in this conversation" — a card this surface did not draw.
 * So every high-risk action was permanently unreachable here, and the operator was told to click
 * something that did not exist. That is the §70 dead end this closes.
 *
 * WHAT THE ECHO IS, AND WHY TEXT WILL NOT DO. Approving by sending the sentence alone does not
 * approve nothing — it silently falls back to the model's assertion, which is by SCOPE rather
 * than by call ("something was approved", not "this was"). So the fingerprints ride the ordinary
 * next POST as `approvedConfirmations`, and a refusal rides it as `declinedConfirmations` —
 * a prose-only "no" leaves the proposal redeemable for its whole window.
 *
 * The fingerprints are a PARAMETER of `run`, never component state. They are content-derived and
 * therefore stable forever, so a surface that remembered one and echoed it on every later request
 * would silently auto-approve the next identical proposal without anybody clicking.
 *
 * HONEST FAILURE (§13). A refused or broken stream lands in the transcript as a turn that says
 * what failed. It never disappears, and it never leaves a half-written answer looking complete.
