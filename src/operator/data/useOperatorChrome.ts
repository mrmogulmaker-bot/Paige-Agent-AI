/**
 * The live signal the operator console's CHROME reads — the rail badges, the rail footer, the
 * header greeting and its status pill. REAL rows only.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND (§13/§57). Claude Design's pack draws a badge on every
 * branch and a count in every group header because a design pack can invent its numbers. This
 * console cannot: it is the operator's source of truth about his OWN platform, and the anchor
 * case for getting it wrong is a Fleet surface that once printed $397 MRR on tenants with no
 * subscription at all. So a count we cannot substantiate is ABSENT — the key is simply not in
 * `badges`, and the chrome draws no badge. Never a `0` standing in for "we didn't read it",
 * never a plausible number. Every figure below traces to a row this hook actually read.
 *
 * COUNTS ARE `count: "exact", head: true`, NEVER `rows.length` (§13). A PostgREST `select()`
 * is capped by the project's `max-rows` setting, so counting by fetching the rows and taking
 * `.length` reports the CAP as the total the moment the fleet outgrows it — a wrong number that
 * looks completely plausible, which is the exact failure class above. An exact head-count is
 * correct at any size and transfers no rows.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING:
 *   • `fleet` badge + `statusSummary` — REAL. `systems_check_snapshot('operator')` (the shipped
 *     RPC the Systems Check tile already reads, §18 one seam) returns the latest OPERATOR-scope
 *     scan run and its findings. Red/amber follows the mapping `SystemsCheckTile` uses, so the
 *     rail and the tile can never disagree: an open `fail` at `blocking` severity is red; every
 *     other open fail is amber, and so is an open `error` — a check that FAILED TO RUN is a real
 *     problem, not a benign neutral. A `skip` is "not yet assessable" and counts as neither.
 *   • `tenantCount` / `subAccountCount` — REAL, from `tenants`. A sub-account is a row with a
 *     non-null `parent_tenant_id` (§51). Nothing else is excluded; this is the whole fleet, so
 *     the footer matches what the Fleet Console lists rather than a differently-filtered total.
 *     Both operator tiers genuinely read the whole table: SELECT on `tenants` is the OR of
 *     "Platform staff read all tenants" (`is_platform_admin()`) and "Members read own tenant"
 *     (`is_tenant_member(id) OR is_platform_owner()`), so super_admin and platform_admin each
 *     clear one of the two.
 *   • `support` badge — REAL, from `support_tickets` (the platform support inbox: it has no
 *     tenant column, the operator IS the desk), and read ONLY when this session holds
 *     `super_admin`. See the §9/§53 note below — this gate is load-bearing, not a formality.
 *     Open = anything not `resolved`/`closed`, the same predicate `SupportAdmin` uses.
 *   • `roleLabel` — REAL, from `user_roles` for THIS session's own uid ("Users can view own
 *     roles" is a self-read policy, so it works for every operator tier).
 *   • `provisioning` badge — ABSENT ON PURPOSE. `tenant_provisioning` still exists, but its only
 *     writers (the new-tenant trigger, the queue drain, `run_starter_provisioning`) were all
 *     dropped by `20260915000000_remove_starter_auto_provisioner.sql` when the owner ruled that
 *     nothing auto-provisions. Whatever rows remain are a dead historical ledger, so counting
 *     them as "pending" would put a number on the rail that nothing is working on — exactly the
 *     phantom this file exists to prevent. There is no other provisioning-request queue in the
 *     schema. When one ships, it gets a badge here.
 *   • `incident` — ALWAYS null today. There is no incident table anywhere in the schema (the
 *     generated types and the migrations both have nothing). The field is part of the contract
 *     so the banner can light up the day a real incident record exists; until then the console
 *     says nothing rather than dressing a support ticket up as an outage.
 *
 * §9/§53 — "NO ROWS" IS UNKNOWN, NOT ZERO, AND "SOME ROWS" IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY THE ANSWER.
 * Two different hazards, and only the first is fixed by withholding zeros:
 *   1. A seam we cannot read at all returns 0 rows and looks identical to a genuinely empty one.
 *      So every count here is emitted only when it is POSITIVE — an unreadable seam and an empty
 *      one both render as no badge, the honest outcome for both, instead of a confident "0".
 *      `subAccountCount` is the one legitimate zero: it is a subset of a fleet we did read, so it
 *      only reports 0 when the fleet itself was readable.
 *   2. A seam we can PARTIALLY read returns a positive count of the WRONG rows, and withholding
 *      zeros does nothing about it. `support_tickets` is exactly this. It carries TWO permissive
 *      SELECT policies, which Postgres ORs together: "Staff view all tickets"
 *      (`is_platform_owner()`, which §53 freezes to super_admin) AND "Users view own tickets"
 *      (`auth.uid() = user_id`, which applies to EVERY authenticated session). A `platform_admin`
 *      therefore does not read zero — they read their OWN filed tickets, and publishing that as
 *      "the platform support inbox" is a worse lie than a zero would have been. So the support
 *      read is gated on the session actually holding `super_admin`; for a platform_admin the key
 *      is absent, which honestly says "this desk is not readable from here."
 * (The Systems Check RPC gates on `is_platform_operator()`, so a platform_admin genuinely does
 * see the operator lens there, and `tenants` is readable by both tiers — see above. Support is
 * the one seam where the tiers diverge.)
