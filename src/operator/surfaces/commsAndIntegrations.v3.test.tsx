/**
 * The failure these assertions exist to stop is the one this console has already shipped twice:
 * a surface that typechecks, lints, resolves a route and renders NOTHING a human can read.
 * Counting exports proves the module is addressed; only rendered CONTENT proves the port.
 *
 * Every string asserted below is verbatim pack copy with its line cited in the component, and
 * no assertion is on a figure that was typed — the counts are derived from the catalogue, so a
 * catalogue edit moves them rather than making this file lie.
