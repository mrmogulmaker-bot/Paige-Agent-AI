/**
 * BUILD-ORDER Layer 3a, pinned.
 *
 * Three invariants, and each one is a defect this console has actually shipped before:
 *
 * 1. NOTHING IS INVENTED WHEN NOTHING IS WIRED. All three surfaces ship with no rows, which is
 *    the finished Layer 3 state under structure-before-data. `P.PEOPLE`, `P.THREADS` and
 *    `P.SEGMENTS` are CD's illustration — records carrying EINs and billing methods, message
 *    bodies, member lists — and a later edit that "helpfully" seeds them would put invented
 *    people on an operator's screen. So the empty render is asserted to carry the AUTHORED
 *    absence and none of the pack's fixture strings.
 *
 * 2. AN UNSIZED SEGMENT IS NOT A ZERO. `segVals` shows no count where the clauses cannot be
 *    resolved — *"the rule is sound; the history it reads is not there yet, so no count is shown
 *    rather than a plausible one."* A rendered `0` asserts that nobody matches, which is a
 *    different and false claim, so the em-dash is pinned against a future "sensible default".
 *
 * 3. A MASK IS A DISPLAY STATE OVER THE REAL VALUE. The bullets are derived from what is on
 *    file, so a reveal shows the record rather than a number invented at render time — and,
 *    before a reveal, the real digits must not be in the markup at all.
