/**
 * Settings → Integrations — the connection grid.
 *
 * PORTED FROM the v3 pack, not from memory and not from the superseded `super-admin-shell/`:
 *   markup   `PAIGE Super Admin Shell v3.dc.html` L1577–L1659  (the `showInts` block)
 *   geometry `PAIGE Super Admin Shell v3.dc.html` L7928–L8082  (`intVals(on)`)
 *   contract `paige-ia.js` L1464–L1471 (`P.INT_KINDS`) and L1473–L1538 (`P.INTEGRATIONS`)
 *
 * `PORT-SPEC-palette-and-six-surfaces.md` lists an "Integrations grid" as its §7 but the
 * document body ends after §5 (1392 lines), so §7 was never written. The pack itself draws
 * the surface in full, so this is a port, never a blocker (PACK-FIRST).
 *
 * WHAT IS STRUCTURE HERE, AND WHY THE CATALOGUE COMES OVER. `P.INTEGRATIONS` is not a fixture
 * set: it carries no invented figure, no tenant name, no timestamp and no sample prose. It is
 * the pack's own grounded contract about this repo — the pack states the rule above it
 * ("live = a seam exists in supabase/functions today; stub = the adapter is written and
 * waiting on credentials; planned = nothing built"), and `corrections-2026-08-23.md` §4 shows
 * CC correcting an entry in it (Stripe's note) rather than treating it as disposable. So the
 * eight shelves, the forty-two named vendors, their kind, what each does, the note and the
 * `blocks` line all port verbatim, exactly as `P.SUMMONS`'s row `name`/`status` pairs do.
 *
 * `connectionStates` is the drop-in for backend slice I (`usePlatformConfig`): a live read of
 * what is actually connected overrides the catalogue's authored state per vendor. Nothing here
 * writes that hook — it is another agent's file — and the surface renders correctly without it.
 *
 * ELEVATION — RULING F (Claude Design, 2026-08-23): elevation is distance from `--pg-env`, and
 * `--pg-surface`/`--pg-workspace` both sit ABOVE canvas in dark and BELOW it in light, so a
 * plate painted on either RECEDES in light. Applied per element:
 *   vendor tile        RISES   → `--pg-raised` (pack L8050 paints `--pg-workspace`, which inverts)
 *   tile monogram well RECEDES → `--pg-surface` (pack L8044, kept: inside a raised parent it is
 *                                darker in BOTH themes, so the role does not invert)
 *   search field       RECEDES → `--pg-surface` (pack L8071 paints `--pg-canvas`, which is darker
 *                                than the workspace ground in dark and LIGHTER in light)
 *   shelf gutter       neither → `--pg-line-soft`, a line token, ported verbatim
 *
 * TWO RAW HEXES ARE PORTED VERBATIM. `KIND_TONE` (pack L7986–L7988) is four `--pg-*` tokens plus
 * `MCP:'#2F6B8F'` and `CalDAV:'#3F7F5C'`. No token carries either value, so substituting one
 * would be inventing a design decision rather than porting it. Both are decorative marks (a 6px
 * diamond and a 2px rail), never text. Reported rather than silently resolved (§13/§00).
