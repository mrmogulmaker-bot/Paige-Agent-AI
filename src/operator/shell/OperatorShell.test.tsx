 * blank card on all 78 screens (`src/operator/CLAUDE.md`). Counting slots proves the tree is
 * addressed and proves nothing about what anyone sees, so every assertion here reads the DOM the
 * shell actually produced.
 *
 * Folder convention: react-dom/server, no RTL. `signOut` is mocked because importing it pulls in
 * the supabase client, which is not this test's subject.
