/**
 * The spine's prop seam — the shapes a real read hands the chrome.
 *
 * THIS FILE DECLARES NO DATA. Every type here is a hole the wiring round fills from a real
 * source; the pack's own values for these shapes (its transcript, its `Memory 5`, its `4/7`,
 * its `7c11`/`b204`, its `Thought for 4s`) are FIXTURES and are not in this repo. What IS
 * ported is the SHAPE they occupy, so the day the chat engine lands the component tree does
 * not change — only these props stop being `undefined`.
 *
 * §18 — the platform already has a Paige chat engine. Nothing in this file is a chat engine,
 * a thread store, a streaming client or a send path. `SpineTurn` is a rendering contract: the
 * caller owns threads, messages, streaming and every callback.
 *
 * Pack: `docs/design-references/cd-packs/super-admin-shell-v3/PAIGE Super Admin Shell v3.dc.html`
 *   spine markup            L3821–L4186
 *   `spineFaces`            L10365–L10372
 *   `trustVals` / `LV`      L4577–L4664
