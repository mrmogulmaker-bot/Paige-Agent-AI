/**
 * The spine's port contract.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE PINNED HERE, and they are the two the console has already got wrong.
 *
 * 1. THE COLLAPSE STAYS HONEST (Ruling C). With no real read the spine has nothing to show,
 *    `spineHasContent()` is false, and the component renders NOTHING — not a populated-looking
 *    shell on fixtures, which is the failure this console has had twice. Asserted on the
 *    RENDERED markup, because counting regions proves the tree is addressed and proves nothing
 *    about what anyone sees (`src/operator/CLAUDE.md`).
 *
 * 2. NO FIXTURE CROSSED OVER. The pack's invented values are read out of the pack itself and
 *    asserted absent from every file in this directory, so the test fails if a later edit
 *    pastes one in rather than wiring a read (§13).
 *
 * Folder convention: react-dom/server, no RTL.
