/**
 * OperatorShell — the operator console's geometry. Band above, three columns beneath.
 *
 * PORTED FROM THE PACK, not from what was here (§30 — strip, do not layer). The shell this
 * replaces was a two-column grid built for seventeen branches in two collapsible groups over a
 * three-level tree; none of that machinery survives contact with six flat slots, so none of it
 * was carried across. The pack's own geometry (`v3.dc.html` L71-L126, `shellStyle` L10728,
 * `canvasStyle` L11040):
 *
 *   root      height:100vh · flex column · overflow:hidden      ← the document never scrolls
 *   band      flex:none · min-height:36px                       ← spans all three columns
 *   shell     flex:1 · min-height:0 · display:grid
 *             216px | minmax(0,1fr) | minmax(340px,26vw)        ← at rest
 *              72px | minmax(0,1fr) | minmax(340px,26vw)        ← rail compact
 *             216px | minmax(0,1fr) | 0px                       ← spine collapsed
 *             transition: grid-template-columns 200ms cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)
 *   canvas    grid-template-rows: 58px minmax(0,1fr)
 *             grid-template-columns: minmax(320px,1fr) minmax(0,52%)  ← a summon in `split`
 *
 * RULE 4 IS SYSTEMATIC HERE, NOT SPOT-CHECKED. Every grid and flex child carries an explicit
 * `min-w-0` (and `min-h-0` wherever it is a vertical child), because the browser's `auto`
 * minimum sizes a track by its CONTENT: one long tenant name, one unbroken canonical path, one
 * wide table and the track blows out at a width nobody tests. That defect landed six times
 * during design; the fix is a rule applied to every child, not to the ones that looked risky.
 *
 * THE COMMAND ROW IS THE COMMAND BAR'S HOME (L128-L159). The 58px band carries the bar, its
 * palette and the fold-spine control — the bar spans the row (`flex:1;min-width:0`, L129) and
 * the palette is a dropdown anchored to it, never a centred modal. See `CommandBar` for the
 * markup and `SummonedSurface` for what a palette row opens.
 *
 * §58 — WHAT THIS ROUND DOES NOT CARRY YET, said plainly rather than left to be discovered. The
 * seventeen-branch console's live surfaces (Fleet Console, Systems Check, History, Team Pulse,
 * Alert Rules, Trust Compass, Knowledge, and the panel-spec surfaces) are addressed
 * `/operator/{branch}/{subtab}` and have no address in the six-slot IA. Their modules are
 * untouched on disk and the shell that mounted them is preserved at
 * `src/operator/legacy/OperatorLegacyApp.tsx` — nothing was deleted — but while this shell owns
 * `/operator/*` they are NOT reachable. Wiring them into the slots is the next round's work.

 * solely in `AdminLayout`, a tree `/operator/*` never enters — so the operator console had no

 * a rival listener here.
 *
 * The route taken: MOUNT THE EXISTING PROVIDER over the operator subtree and let its shared

 * and the state all stay in the one shared home; what differs per shell is only WHAT the open
 * state renders — `CommandLauncher` under `AdminLayout`, the pack's dropdown here. No second
 * listener, no second palette implementation, no fork of the context.
 *
 * The alternative — lifting the launcher itself into a shared module — would have meant editing
 * `src/components/ui/paige/**`, which is outside this change's file scope; it is also the larger
 * change, since `CommandLauncher` is a Radix `CommandDialog` and the pack's palette is a
 * dropdown anchored to the bar. Nothing here forecloses it: this shell reads the context, so a
 * later lift changes where the state lives without touching the operator surfaces.

          once — this row track, the canvas grid row, and the slide-over's `top` offset — and they
          drift apart the moment one is guessed.

          THE ONE VALUE THAT IS NOT THE PACK'S, AND WHY. The pack sets this row `z-index:6`
          (L128) and the palette it hosts `z-index:8` (L142), while `viewRowStyle` sets the
          sub-tab row `z-index:12` (L10803) with the comment "Raised above any summoned panel."
          Those two cannot both hold: this row carries `z-index`, so it opens a stacking context
          and the palette's 8 is CLAMPED inside it — an OPAQUE `--pg-raised` dropdown at 6 that
          the view row paints straight over at 12. MEASURED, before this change:
          `elementFromPoint` at the centre of the "Run a sequence" row returned
          `<nav class="relative z-[12] …">`, not the palette button, in both themes, while the
          palette's own computed background was `rgb(33,29,39)` / `rgb(255,253,248)` at
          `opacity: 1`. It was never transparency; it was paint order.

          Claude Design ruled the conflict (2026-08-23): "nothing behind a summoned layer should
          be readable through it" — the summoned layer sits ABOVE the view row. The pack's own
          ladder is row(6) < summoned(8) < view row(12); it is preserved and shifted over the
          view row: this row 13, `SummonedSurface` 14. The palette keeps the pack's `z-index:8`
          inside this row, because raising it alone could never have escaped a context 6 sets. */}
