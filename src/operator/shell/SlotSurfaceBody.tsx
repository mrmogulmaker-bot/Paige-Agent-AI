/**
 * Resolves a slot/view address to what actually renders there.
 *
 * Three outcomes, in this order (`viewSources.ts` decides which):
 *   1. a BESPOKE component that already reads live data — mounted with its real hook;
 *   2. one or more PORTED CD panel specs — the surface's designed shape, figures still stand-ins;
 *   3. ABSENCE — nothing shipped answers this view, so it says so.
 *
 * (3) is why this file exists. Rendering a header, a tab row and an empty section is the
 * blank-screen failure this console has already been rejected for twice; an absence that names
 * what is missing is the designed alternative and reads as a decision rather than a bug.
 *
 * HOOK ORDER IS UNCONDITIONAL. Every read is declared on every render and gated by its own
 * `enabled` flag, the shape `useFleet`/`useCompass` already use — an inactive surface costs
 * nothing, and no early return can change how many hooks ran.

/**
 * RULING F (Claude Design, 2026-08-23) — ELEVATION IS DISTANCE FROM `--pg-env`.
 * `--pg-surface` sits ABOVE canvas in dark and BELOW it in light, so the role inverts between
 * themes and a plate painted on it RECEDES in light. A plate that rises off the canvas — a card,
 * a KPI tile, a control, a popover — paints `--pg-raised` in BOTH themes; `--pg-surface` is kept
 * for regions that genuinely recede (a well, an inset strip, a sunken list).
 *
 * AND FILL ALONE CANNOT CARRY IT (Claude Design, 2026-08-23). In light, `--pg-raised` `#fffdf8`
 * on `--pg-canvas` `#fbf9f5` is three units — correct, and invisible on its own. Separation on a
 * raised plate is `--pg-rim` PLUS `--pg-lift-1`: the rim is a seated inset pair (a top highlight
 * and a bottom shade, L21/L28) and the lift is the outer cast (L22/L29). Carrying the rim alone
 * left only insets, which read as a plain outline against the 1.5px border — the "hairline
 * outline" CD reported. Both tokens ship at the pack's own values; this is where they are spent.
 * The pack pairs them exactly this way at L9420 and L9477: `var(--pg-rim), var(--pg-lift-N)`.
 *
 * AND WHY THE RIM WAS NOT PAINTING AT ALL — measured, not inferred. `shadow-[shadow:var(--pg-rim)]`
 * does NOT compile to a box-shadow. Tailwind 3 cannot type a bare `var()` and resolves the
 * `shadow-` arbitrary value to `--tw-shadow-COLOUR`; the emitted rule is
 * `{--tw-shadow-color: var(--pg-rim)}` (verified in the built CSS), which recolours a shadow
 * that was never declared, so `getComputedStyle(...).boxShadow` came back `none` on every one
 * of these plates in BOTH themes. All the separation on screen was the 1.5px border — which is
 * exactly why it read as "a plain border." The `shadow:` data-type hint
 * (`shadow-[shadow:var(--pg-rim),var(--pg-lift-1)]`) is what makes Tailwind emit `box-shadow`,
 * the same hint `text-[length:var(--pg-t-body)]` already uses throughout this console.

 *
 * *"~370 KB of ported pack surface that never reaches a screen… That is a dispatch problem, not
 * a port problem — most of it is one file away from being on screen."* Correct about the
 * dispatch. The size is the part worth re-measuring, and it changes what may be mounted.
 *
 * **Only FOUR of the unmounted files are ports of THIS pack.** Every surface under `surfaces/`
 * was checked for which pack it cites, allowing for a citation wrapped across comment lines:
 *
 *   v3 (`PAIGE Super Admin Shell v3.dc.html`) ..... 93 KB — the four below
 *   SUPERSEDED (`Super Admin Shell.dc.html`) ..... 232 KB — MarketplaceSurfaces ·
 *       CalendarSurfaces · PipelineSurfaces · SettingsSurfaces · AnalyticsSurfaces ·
 *       SocialSurfaces · ComposeSurface · SupportThread · OperatorChatRail
 *
 * The 232 KB is a port of the pack the owner ruled dead on 2026-08-22. `SettingsSurfaces.tsx`
 * names its source in its own header — *"Claude Design's five settings surfaces, on CD's one
 * panel layout (Super Admin Shell.dc.html)"* — and cites L5024 / L6382 / L6857 / L6334 / L4968,
 * which in v3 land on a deal-notes foot, a mark style and `segVals`. Different document.
 *
 * **Mounting those would inject the retired design into the new shell** — the exact failure the
 * redesign exists to end, arriving through the fix for it. They are not mounted here. They are
 * §30 strip candidates, and that is its own slice with its own evidence.
