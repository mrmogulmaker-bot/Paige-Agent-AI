/**
 * URL ⇄ IA. The one place an operator address becomes a slot and a view (§18).
 *
 * The console is URL-DRIVEN, not state-driven: `/operator/{slot}/{view}` resolves against
 * `OPERATOR_SLOTS` on every render, so there is no local tab state to drift out of sync with
 * the address bar — which is what keeps all thirty-two views deep-linkable and Paige-addressable
 * (§10/§65).
 *
 * TWO FAILURES, KEPT APART — this distinction is carried forward from the shell this replaces,
 * where it was the one genuinely load-bearing idea in the resolver:
 *   • An UNKNOWN SLOT is a dead address. It renders a 404 that names it. It does NOT silently
 *     redirect to Fleet — a redirect throws away the address the operator (or an agent, or a
 *     shared link) actually asked for, and hides the fact that it was wrong.
 *   • A KNOWN slot with an unknown VIEW is a stale address. Its slot is real and its default
 *     view is the honest answer, so the caller canonicalises the URL rather than rendering one
 *     view while the address bar names another.
 *
 * Rule 6: every catalogue read here is guarded. A slot carrying no views resolves `view: null`
 * rather than indexing into an empty array.
