/**
 * The operator console's information architecture — six slots, thirty-two views.
 *
 * This is OUR mirror of the pack's `P.PLACES` + `P.DEST` (see
 * `docs/design-references/cd-packs/super-admin-shell-v3/paige-ia.js`). The pack is the design
 * source of truth; a Vite bundle cannot import a design artifact at runtime, so the IA ships as
 * this module and a test asserts the two agree. Change the pack, then change this, in the same PR.
 *
 * SIX SLOTS, NOT SEVEN. Ruled three times during design: a rail slot is a body of work with its own
 * objects and its own performance. Everything else is a view, a summoned surface, or a mechanism.
 * Sequences folded into Active; Follow-ups became an automation; Field became Marketplace with
 * Calendar moving to Relationships. **Do not add a slot without an owner ruling.**
 *
 * DIRECTION OF ACCOMMODATION (owner, 2026-08-23). The backend is built to fit this design, never
 * the reverse. A correction about which table, column or join holds a record is ours to make; a
 * change to what the surface looks like, where a capability lives, or how something reads is a
 * redesign request and the answer is no — if a table cannot serve the design, the table changes.
 *
 * COPY IS SURFACE. The absence copy below is the DESIGN SIDE'S, lifted verbatim from the pack's
 * `docs/handoff/absence-copy.md` — it replaced a CC draft that was on its way to becoming settled
 * design by having shipped first. Do not edit these strings here; they change at the source.
 *
 * Each does a specific job, worth knowing before anyone "tidies" them. Relationships distinguishes
 * DRAWN from WIRED, because an operator seeing an empty slot assumes the question is still open —
 * this says the decision is closed and only the seam is missing, so nobody re-opens it. Campaigns
 * names the tables so the slot is not rebuilt from scratch, AND names the missing seam so nobody
 * finds `utm_campaign` on `analytics_events`, assumes the join exists, and hits it at the join.
 *
 * SUB-TAB COUNT IS NOT SLOT PRESSURE. The thirteen-branch tree this replaces carried 83 sub-tabs.
 * That is not an argument for more slots — every homeless sub-tab is a view, a summoned surface, or
 * a mechanism that was never a place. Anything without a slot is reached through the command
 * palette: a capability opens its own surface and retires when you close it, and none holds a place
 * in the rail.
