/**
 * The drop-nothing guarantee, enforced rather than asserted.
 *
 * The thirteen-branch console's interface is gone; its features are supposed to have been placed,
 * not lost. Prose saying so is worth nothing — the failure mode is a capability quietly having no
 * home, which looks exactly like a capability nobody has got to yet. So this walks the SHIPPED
 * branch registry and fails if any leaf is neither carried by a view nor explicitly retired.
 *
 * It reads OPERATOR_BRANCHES rather than a copy of it, so adding a branch there without placing it
 * breaks this test — which is the point. A list restated here could drift from the tree it claims
 * to cover, and would then prove only that it agrees with itself.
