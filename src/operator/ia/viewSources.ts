/**
 * WHERE EACH VIEW'S FEATURE ALREADY LIVES — the map from the six-slot IA onto shipped code.
 *
 * The thirteen-branch console is gone as an INTERFACE. Its FEATURES are not: every capability it
 * carried is placed here against one of the thirty-two views, so nothing that shipped disappears
 * because the shell around it changed. This is a mapping with one right answer per feature, not a
 * design question — the pack owns what the console looks like, this file owns where the existing
 * work plugs in.
 *
 * Three kinds of source, and the difference matters at render time:
 *
 *   "bespoke"  a real component that already reads live data — mount it.
 *   "panel"    one or more ported CD panel specs (`getPanelSpec`) that describe the surface's
 *              shape. All 78 of the old tree's leaves have one; they are structure, and their
 *              figures are stand-ins until a read is wired.
 *   none       nothing shipped answers this view. It renders the ABSENCE treatment, which names
 *              what is missing. A header over an empty section is the blank-screen failure this
 *              console has already been rejected for twice; absence is the designed alternative.
 *
 * The old address is recorded on every entry. That is the audit trail for "did anything get
 * dropped" — `viewSources.test.ts` walks the shipped branch registry and fails if a leaf appears
 * in no entry, so a feature cannot go missing silently the way it would have if this were prose.
