// The one guard above all 78 operator routes, tested for the one thing static review keeps
// missing: WHOSE grant it is acting on (§9, §39 peer-gate finding on PR #546).
//
// The defect this file locks shut: the guard used to treat `useTenantContext`'s
// `isPlatformStaff || isPlatformOwner` as an ALLOW while its own server check was still in
// flight. Those flags live on a provider mounted at the app ROOT, which never unmounts, and
// they are refreshed on SIGNED_IN by a BACKGROUND load that bails without committing on a
// transient failure. So when a DIFFERENT user's session landed — a second sign-in in the same
// tab, a magic link, the cross-tab broadcast of a session created in another tab — the previous
// operator's `true` was still sitting there and admitted the new user to the whole console.
//
// Every case below therefore pins the tenant context to the MOST DANGEROUS possible value —
// `{ isPlatformStaff: true, isPlatformOwner: true }`, always, for everyone. Any render of the
// console in these tests can only have come from a server answer keyed to the uid that is
// signed in at that moment. If someone re-introduces an unkeyed cache as an allow path, these
// go red.
