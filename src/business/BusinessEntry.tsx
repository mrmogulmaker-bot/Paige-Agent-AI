/**
 * BusinessEntry — the `/business/*` dispatcher (§65 R3c-i).
 *
 * Mounted at `/business/*`, always rendering the sub-account shell under a
 * nested `:account/*` route so it receives `account` + the branch splat from
 * `useParams()` and drives every tab as a real deep-linkable URL, mirroring
 * `AgencyEntry`'s numeric-segment leg (§18 reuse — same shell, same routing
 * machinery, tier-parameterized rather than forked).
 *
 * Unlike `/agency/*`, there is no legacy standalone board to fork against here
 * — a sub-account has only ever rendered inline at `the retired privileged route` (Admin.tsx Gate B),
 * never at its own top-level route — so this dispatcher has a single leg.
 *
 * IT NOW GUARDS LIKE ITS SIBLING (§18). This entry used to check only
 * `accountContextLoading` and then mount, while its docblock asserted that
 * "`AgencyApp`'s own top-level ownership guard keeps the `:account` segment
 * honest against the caller's real tenant." That protection was never
 * implemented for a caller of the WRONG TIER — `AgencyApp` resolves the
 * CALLER'S OWN account number, so it rewrote the URL and left them in the
 * sub-account shell — and the entry also mounted the shell while the active
 * tenant was still unresolved. `SoloEntry` already had the correct shape for
 * both, so this adopts it rather than inventing a second one: resolve the
 * account context first, refuse to mount on an unresolved or errored context,
 * and only then ask whether this caller's tier owns this shell.
 *
 * NOT DECIDING IS A REAL ANSWER. A null `activeTenant` is not "tier solo" — it
 * is "we do not know yet", and `switchTenant` can produce exactly that window
 * because it commits the new id before the tenant list refetches. Classifying
 * an unresolved caller would eject them out of a shell they legitimately own,
 * so the gate is never asked until there is a tenant to ask about.
 *
 * The tier gate itself fails CLOSED: a caller whose SERVER-DERIVED tier does not
 * own this shell goes to their own authorized root, or to the entry chooser when
 * there is no single home to name. It never falls back into another tenant as a
 * convenience. The classification comes from `useTenantContext`, never from the
 * `:account` URL segment — the address is an address, never a grant (§9/§65).
