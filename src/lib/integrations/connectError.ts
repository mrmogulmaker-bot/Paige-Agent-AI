/**
 * connectError — the ONE home (§18) for turning a `supabase.functions.invoke()`
 * failure into an honest, friendly, code-aware message for a tenant.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (Cowork #156): `supabase.functions.invoke()` returns
 * `{ data, error }`. On a NON-2xx response the framework sets `data = null` and
 * `error` to a `FunctionsHttpError` whose `.context` is the raw `Response` — the
 * honest JSON body (e.g. `{ error: "gmail_oauth_not_configured" }`) lives INSIDE
 * that Response, not on `data`. Call sites that read the code from `data` only
 * therefore miss it on a non-2xx and fall through to `error.message`, which is the
 * raw framework string "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" — jargon a
 * coach should NEVER see (§3/§13/§36). This helper reads the code from BOTH shapes
 * (2xx-with-error on `data`, and non-2xx from the Response body), maps known codes
 * to plain-English copy, and ALWAYS falls back to a friendly line — never the raw
 * message.
 *
 * PURE + framework-agnostic: it returns `{ code, message }` and shows nothing
 * itself. The caller decides toast vs. inline note (a needs-config state is an
 * honest inline note, not a red error scream — §13/§36).
