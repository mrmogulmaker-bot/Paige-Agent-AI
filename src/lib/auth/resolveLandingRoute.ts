/**
 * Agency default-landing (#191). For a staff user who would otherwise land on
 * `/admin`, decide whether they should instead open their Agency operator side.
 *
 * Eligibility is SERVER-PROVEN (§13), never `account_type` (which flips to the
 * child's on entry): `agency_switch_context().is_agency_manager` is the authority.
 * An eligible operator's per-owner preference (`profiles.agency_login_default`,
 * default 'agency') decides WHERE:
 *   - 'agency'       → open the agency shell (also the brand-new-owner default).
 *   - 'last_account' → resume their last active account (→ /admin, which reads
 *                      profiles.active_tenant_id).
 * Returns a route only when eligible AND preference is 'agency'; otherwise null
 * so the caller falls through to "/admin". Non-agency users get null (unaffected).
 *
 * §65 R0 — LAND ON THE REAL URL, AT THE SOURCE. This used to return the bare
 * `/agency`, which `AgencyEntry` (non-numeric first segment) routes to the LEGACY
 * `AgencyLayout` board — so an owner whose preference is 'agency' (the default for
 * EVERY newly provisioned owner) never reached the URL-driven shell, while an owner
 * on 'last_account' reached it only incidentally via `/admin`'s Gate-A redirect.
 * We now emit the same address Gate A emits (`Admin.tsx` — `/agency/{n}/command-center`),
 * so both entry points agree. The fix is here, at the SENDER: bare `/agency` is NOT
 * redirected inside `AgencyEntry`, because `AgencyLayout` links to bare `/agency`
 * itself (its Dashboard nav item, its logo link, and its `*` catch-all) — redirecting
 * it would break the legacy board's own navigation and effectively retire it, which
 * is §65's LAST migration step, not this one. The legacy board stays fully intact
 * and reachable at bare `/agency` (§58).
 *
 * §13 HONEST FALLBACK — `agency_account_number` is an ADDITIVE key on
 * `agency_switch_context()`. If it is absent or non-numeric for ANY reason (the
 * migration that adds it hasn't reached prod yet, an older cached client, a genuinely
 * missing value), we return exactly what we returned before — bare `/agency` — rather
 * than constructing `/agency/null/command-center`, which would be strictly worse than
 * the bug this fixes. Never build a URL out of a null.

    // resolves to it and silently bounces them off the agency they were invited to.

 *
 * Self-healing: if the signed-in user is linked to a `clients` row but is
 * missing the `client` role (legacy invites that activated before role grant
 * was added), call `ensure_client_role_self_heal()` to backfill the role and
 * onboarding stage so the workspace + onboarding gates accept them.
 *
 * Priority:

 *   2. broker / broker_team_member → /broker/app
 *   3. linked client (clients.linked_user_id = user.id) → /onboard/<stage> or /workspace
 *   4. tenant owner/member with no synced role yet → /admin
 *   5. fallback (signed in, no role, no client link, no tenant) → /pricing
 *
 * Pay-before-workspace (B-Platform): a workspace/tenant only exists after a paid
 * platform subscription (the checkout webhook provisions the tenant). A signed-in
 * user with no staff role, no client linkage, and no tenant membership therefore has
 * NOT paid yet — a tenant requires a subscription, so no-tenant ⇒ no active sub. Send
 * them to /pricing to choose a plan and subscribe, NOT to a free onboarding gate that
 * would stand up a workspace without payment. Real tenant owners/members are already
 * caught by branch 4 (→ /admin) BEFORE this fallback, so paid users are unaffected.
