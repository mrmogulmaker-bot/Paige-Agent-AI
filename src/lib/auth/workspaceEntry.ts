/**
 * Workspace entry and containment — the ONE home for "may this caller be on this
 * route, and where do they belong instead?" (§18).
 *
 * OWNER RULING 2026-09-02. Account choice happens at ENTRY, never inside a
 * workspace. A person authenticates as themselves first; the platform then
 * determines their server-authorized top-level contexts; if there is more than
 * one they choose at `/choose-account`; and once they enter a Solo workspace
 * that shell is LOCKED to that single authorized context. Returning to another
 * authorized workspace means explicitly LEAVING and re-entering through the
 * chooser — never an in-shell picker, and never an automatic fallback.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN AN INLINE CHECK IN EACH ENTRY. `/business/*`
 * shipped with no tier gate at all (`BusinessEntry` checked only
 * `accountContextLoading`), while its docblock asserted that "`AgencyApp`'s own
 * top-level ownership guard keeps the `:account` segment honest against the
 * caller's real tenant." That guard resolves the CALLER'S OWN account number, so
 * for a Solo caller it rewrote the URL to `/business/{their own Solo number}` and
 * left them in the sub-account shell — a wrong-mode shell they could not leave,
 * because every exit control in it is gated on owning an agency. The protection
 * the comment described was never implemented. Putting the rule in one tested
 * module is what stops the next entry point from making the same claim.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS IS NEVER THE AUTHORITY (§9/§65). Everything here reads the
 * SERVER-RESOLVED tenant classification. A URL segment, a browser-storage value,
 * a cached query and a client-side mode flag are all untrusted inputs; they can
 * say where someone wants to be, never where they may be.
 */

/**
 * Statuses that are NOT enterable. Everything else is a workspace a person can
 * be in, and must therefore be offered.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FILTER THAT SEALED THE RECOVERY PATH SHUT. The chooser, the exit
 * control and the `/admin` door each asked "how many workspaces does this person
 * have?" by counting tenants whose status is exactly `active` — so a person whose
 * other workspaces are on `trial` counted as having only one, the chooser decided
 * there was nothing to choose, and redirected them back to `/admin` and into the
 * very context they were trying to leave. Measured on production: 8 `active`,
 * 4 `trial`, 1 `canceled`. A trial workspace is live; excluding it was never
 * intended, and the owner hit it while locked out of his own Solo workspace.
 *
 * Stated as a DENY list on purpose. An allow list of "known good" statuses fails
 * in the direction that traps people — every status added later would be silently
 * un-enterable, and the symptom is a person who cannot reach their own workspace.
 * Locking someone out of a status should require naming it here.

// CORRECTION (§13): an earlier version of this comment said zero tenants carry
