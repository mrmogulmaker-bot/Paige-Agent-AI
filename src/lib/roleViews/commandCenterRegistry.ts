// authorship + need RLS + a read binding for zero benefit today; §18 keeps nav/lens
// config in code already). Adding a view = editing this file; wiring a 1c-ix role =
// ONE line in ROLE_TO_PERSONA — no migration, no schema change (the owner's ask).
//
// It adds ZERO new data path: it only SELECTS which existing, already-tenant-scoped
// KPIs/rails/panels a persona sees. The honesty gates are structural (§13):
//  - KpiKey/RailKey unions list ONLY keys that exist in practice_dashboard_metrics /
//    practice_attention_queue, so a metric with no real source (show-rate,
//    cash-collected, …) cannot compile into a tile.
//  - 5 net-new personas are status:"planned", unmapped, never rendered until 1c-ix
//    assigns the enum role.
