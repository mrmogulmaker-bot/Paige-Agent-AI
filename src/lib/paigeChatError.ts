// #587 — Parse a paige-ai-chat error Response into a user-facing { title, description }.
//
// The edge function returns a STRUCTURED { code, reason, recommendation } body on a size/page/outage
// failure (see supabase/functions/paige-ai-chat/index.ts — structuredChatError / preflight). This
// reads that body so the three chat surfaces (PaigeAIChat, PaigeChat, FloatingChatbot) show the
// SPECIFIC message — a 15 MB size limit reads differently from a general outage — instead of the old
// generic "Failed to send message" toast that swallowed the server's real reason.
//
// Degrades gracefully: a missing / non-JSON / legacy body falls back to the generic message, so this
// never throws and never blocks the surface's own error handling.
