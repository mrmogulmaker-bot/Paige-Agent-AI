/**
 * VP ↔ 10-department map — the ONE seam that reconciles the 7-member VP_ROSTER
 * (#243: PAIGE + 6 VPs) with the §16 10-department org model (paige_departments).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (§18 one home). Two surfaces need the same answer to "which VP
 * owns this department's work?": the Command Center department-status tiles
 * (usePaigeDeptStatus / PaigeDepartmentStatus) and the draft byline on ApprovalRow.
 * Rather than each re-deriving the mapping (a second taxonomy — §12/§18 violation),
 * both import it from here.
 *
 * INVENTS NO NAMES (§12/§243). VP identities come ONLY from the exported
 * {@link VP_ROSTER}; department slugs + display names come ONLY from the DB
 * (`paige_departments`, seeded by the §16 migrations). This module holds neither —
 * it is purely the *edges* between the two existing vocabularies. A VP is the
 * C-Suite officer; the departments are the desks that officer runs.
 *
 * SEAM RESOLUTION (§16). The 6 VPs OWN the 10 canonical departments (+ the legacy
 * `owner_ops` general desk, folded under PAIGE while it is routed away). Each
 * department maps to exactly ONE VP so a department's work has an unambiguous owner:
 *
 *   PAIGE  (Orchestrator)            → executive_office, people_talent, owner_ops(legacy)
 *   NEXUS  (Marketing & growth)      → marketing
 *   MERIT  (Sales & revenue)         → sales, finance
 *   CURA   (Client success)          → client_experience
 *   MENTOR (Curriculum & delivery)   → product_curriculum
 *   ZION   (Operations & automation) → technology_automation, operations_pmo
 *   VERA   (Quality & standards)     → legal_compliance
 *
 * COMPILE-SAFE BOTH WAYS (§12). {@link DEPT_VP} is `Record<DeptSlug, VP>` (every
 * department must name an owner) and {@link VP_DEPARTMENTS} is
 * `Record<VP, DeptSlug[]>` (every roster member is accounted for) — so adding a
 * department OR changing the VP roster is a TypeScript error here, never silent drift.
