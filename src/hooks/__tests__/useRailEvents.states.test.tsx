/**
 * The five ways a Rail feed can be wrong, driven through the REAL components.
 *
 * The two owner-facing strips — `PaigeRailFeed` ("Across your clients — live") and
 * `ClientActivityFeed` ("Your activity") — both decided what to say from `events.length === 0`.
 * That one check answered four different questions with one sentence: still loading, refused,
 * failed, and genuinely nothing. Three of those four are not "nothing happened", and two of them
 * are assertions about Paige's work that were never true. Both strips also discarded the read
 * error entirely, so a refusal was indistinguishable from a quiet week.
 *
 * The cases below are the five the repair is answerable for:
 *   1. a successful history                 — the recorded events reach the screen at all
 *   2. an empty history                     — "nothing yet" is said ONLY when it is true
 *   3. a denied read                        — a refusal never renders as "nothing yet"
 *   4. a workspace switch                   — the previous workspace's events never paint under
 *                                             the new one, not even for one frame
 *   5. a stale response                     — a slow answer for a workspace already left is
 *                                             discarded rather than winning by arriving last
 *
 * WHY THESE MOUNT THE COMPONENTS rather than probe the hook. The hook can hold four honest states
 * and still be rendered by a component that collapses them — which is exactly what shipped. What
 * has to be true is that the SURFACE says different things, so the surface is what is read.
