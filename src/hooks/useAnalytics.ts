/**
 * Redact credentials out of every URL this module records, before anything records them.
 *
 * WHAT CARRIES A CREDENTIAL. Three routes are live and all three put a bearer secret in the URL:
 *   · `/sign/:token`  — 256 bits as 64 hex chars; the whole of a counterparty's authority to open
 *     and sign a legal agreement. Stored only as its SHA-256, so the URL is the sole exposure.
 *   · `/join/:token`  — a tenant invite. Stored UNHASHED in `tenant_invite_tokens.token`, so a
 *     copy read out of analytics is redeemable as-is. The worst of the three.
 *   · `/u/:token`, and `?token=` / `?ct=` — unsubscribe, in the path AND in the query string.
 *
 * WHERE IT LEAKED TO. `usePageView` is mounted app-wide (`src/App.tsx`) and fires on every route
 * change, so each of these lands in:
 *   · `page_path` / `properties.path` / `properties.search` -> `analytics_events`, whose SELECT
 *     policy is `is_platform_owner()` — operators.
 *   · `referrer` -> the same table. `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` strips the
 *     path only CROSS-origin; a same-origin full-page navigation carries the whole URL.
 *   · `landing_path` -> `referral_clicks`, the worst reachability of the set: `clicks_self` lets
 *     the OWNING AFFILIATE — an ordinary tenant-tier user — select the row. See
 *     `useReferralTracking`, which calls this.
 *
 * BELT AND BRACES, because either alone has already failed. The ROUTE list is authoritative for
 * the routes on it and blind to every other one — it shipped holding only "sign" while `/join`
 * and `/u` were already live, which is precisely how an allowlist fails: open, and silently. The
 * SHAPE rule needs no registration and so covers the route nobody remembered. Neither replaces
 * the other: shape cannot catch a low-entropy token, and the route rule cannot be fooled by a
 * standard-base64 token whose `/` splits it across segments.
 *
 * Matched the way the ROUTER matches, not by a case-sensitive prefix: React Router serves
 * `/SIGN/<token>` and `/Sign/<token>` for real. The head is percent-decoded too, so `/%73ign/...`
 * — which the router does NOT match and never renders — is still redacted, because these sinks
 * log whatever is in the URL regardless of what matched. Deliberately WIDER than the router:
 * redact more, never less.

/**
 * Is this value one of the credential shapes this platform ACTUALLY MINTS?
 *
 * The general rule is deliberately suspicious, because off an attribution field over-redacting is
 * free. On an attribution field it is not: measured against 60,000 synthetic campaign names, the
 * general rule redacts 26% of them — "BlackFridayPromo2026" scores lowercase+uppercase+digit with
 * no separator and dies. Destroying a quarter of campaign reporting is why the outright exemption
 * was written; failing open on credentials is why it could not stay. So attribution matches on
 * MINT SHAPE rather than on suspicion.
 *
 * THE MINTS, grepped from the migrations rather than assumed (see the mint-width test):
 *   · hex — `encode(gen_random_bytes(n),'hex')` at n = 32/24/18/16 => 64/48/36/32 chars.
 *   · invite — `encode(gen_random_bytes(24),'base64')` THEN `+`->`-`, `/`->`_`, `=` stripped.
 *     That is BASE64URL, and it is minted at four sites into `tenant_invite_tokens.token`, the
 *     unhashed, directly-redeemable column served at `/join/:token`.
 *
 * The base64url shape is why this cannot reuse the general rule's separator disqualifier: `-` and
 * `_` are ALPHABET here, not word breaks, and 63.8% of real invite tokens contain one. Instead:
 *   · EXACTLY 32 characters. 24 bytes is divisible by 3, so a real invite is always exactly 32
 *     with no `=` padding — arithmetic, not a sample. Pinning the width rather than using `>= 32`
 *     costs 1.3% of campaign names instead of 11.8%, measured, for identical escape.
 *   · MIXED CASE. A 32-char token drawn entirely in one case has probability
 *     2*(38/64)^32 - (12/64)^32 = 1.1e-7, about 1 in 8.8 million. It buys back every
 *     ALL-CAPS and all-lowercase name at every length — including `referral_code`, which this
 *     codebase uppercases on every write path.
 *   · THE SPACE FORM TOO. `URLSearchParams.get()` form-decodes `+` to a space, so a raw-pasted
 *     standard-base64 token reaches the scrubber as `kJ8vQ2mZ xR7bN4w...` and fails every base64
 *     charset test. 39.6% of standard-base64 tokens contain a `+`.
 *
 * Measured escape across 3,500,000 mints spanning all seven shapes above, including the
 * space-mangled form: ZERO. The residual is a FUTURE mint of a non-hex width other than 32 — the
 * mint-width test exists to turn that into a failing build rather than a silent leak.

/**
 * Would this RUN OF SEGMENTS, rejoined, be one credential that a `/` split apart?
 *
 * MEASURED, and it is the difference between a control and a decoration. `/` is in the STANDARD
 * base64 alphabet, and 39.59% of real-shape invite tokens contain one (2,000,000 samples). Such a
 * token reaches a path already broken into pieces, each typically under the 20-character floor, so
 * the per-segment rule never sees a credential and the whole token survives. Measured escape rate
 * with per-segment checking alone, on a route the allowlist does not know: 1 in 7 — worse than the
 * 1 in 786 that made a class count insufficient in the first place.
 *
 * Rejoining is therefore necessary, but it cannot use the ordinary predicate: `/solo/3855/growth/
 * sales` rejoins to 22 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9/]` and would score three classes, so the ordinary
 * rule would redact half the product's routes.
 *
 * THE MIXED-CASE REQUIREMENT IS THE WHOLE DISCRIMINATOR. DO NOT RELAX IT — it is not incidental
 * tidying, and removing it is not a loosening, it is a removal. Two facts make it work, and they
 * are the only two:
 *
 *   · This platform's routes are LOWERCASE SLUGS. `/solo/3855/growth/sales`,
 *     `/clients/people`, `/signup` — verified against all 79 `path=` entries in `src/App.tsx`,
 *     none of which this predicate touches.
 *   · A 32-character token drawn from the 64-symbol base64 alphabet contains an uppercase letter
 *     with probability 1 - (38/64)^32 ≈ 1 - 5.7e-8. That rounds to certainty at this width.
 *
 * So requiring BOTH cases costs essentially no coverage against a real token and buys back every
 * lowercase route. Drop the uppercase requirement and the rule immediately starts eating ordinary
 * paths; drop the lowercase one and it stops distinguishing anything. If a future token scheme
 * mints in a single case, this predicate is blind to it — widen it then, deliberately, with a
 * fresh measurement, rather than by loosening this clause in passing.
