/**
 * usePaigeDeptStatus — the live "what is each department doing right now" read for
 * the Command Center department-status tiles (Task #245, the "see them work" layer).
 *
 * §9 TENANT ISOLATION: both reads are RLS-tenant-scoped and pass NO client-supplied
 * tenant_id. `paige_actions` SELECT is gated server-side by the live slice2c policy
 * (tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id() AND admin|coach|super_admin — OR
 * is_platform_owner() → all rows for a platform operator); `paige_departments` is
 * `enabled`-gated to
 * authenticated. This EXTENDS the proven §9-clean pattern in usePaigeContribution —
 * it is NOT a new RPC/view (a SECURITY DEFINER aggregate would *bypass* the RLS that
 * already scopes this table correctly — the exact §45 IDOR class we avoid).
 *
 * §51 PER-TIER OUTCOME:
 *   • God/Super-Admin (no tenant)  → is_platform_owner() → FLEET-WIDE dept status.
 *   • Agency / Standalone / Sub-account → own book only (current_user_tenant_id());
 *     a sub-account never sees its parent's aggregate (RLS isolates by tenant_id).
 *   • Client → fails the admin|coach|super_admin predicate → 0 rows (never mounts CC).
 *   • Anonymous → no session → 0 rows (route is admin-gated anyway).
 *
 * §13 HONESTY: if the departments seed is absent (an env without the §16 migration),
 * `configured` is false and the surface renders a crafted EmptyState — never a
 * fabricated count. Terminal actions (done/dismissed/failed/expired) are excluded so
 * a tile reads only LIVE, open work.
 *
 * §36 FRESHNESS (live refresh): this hook lives inside the PERSISTENT AdminLayout
 * shell (mounted once; inner routes swap without remounting it) AND feeds the
 * hide-when-idle presence rail via `useIsPaigeActive`. A one-shot fetch would freeze
 * the rail's mount state at page-load — Paige starting work post-login would never
 * surface the rail without a hard reload. So the snapshot is kept live: `paige_actions`
 * is NOT in the `supabase_realtime` publication (verified 2026-08-11; adding it is an
 * out-of-scope infra migration), so instead of a realtime subscription we POLL — a
 * cheap tenant-RLS-scoped refetch every 15s plus an immediate refetch on window focus
 * (so returning to the tab is instantly fresh). Background (`document.hidden`) ticks
 * are skipped to avoid needless queries; the focus refetch catches up. Both the rail
 * AND PaigeDepartmentStatus (which share this hook) become live — correct and desired.
