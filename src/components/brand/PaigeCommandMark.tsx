/**
 * PaigeCommandMark — the CURRENT Paige mark (the Command Mark), as a surface-agnostic brand
 * component usable ANYWHERE: marketing, auth, onboarding, product chrome, emails-as-markup.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from `src/operator/shell/CommandMark.tsx`: that one is the operator
 * plate variant, and its colours come from the `--pg-*` / `--cm-*` operator tokens which only
 * resolve inside a `data-pg` shell (OperatorShell / TenantCommandCenterShell). On a marketing or
 * auth page there is no `data-pg`, so those tokens are undefined and the mark would render with no
 * colour. This component carries its OWN theme-aware colours, so the Command Mark reads correctly
 * on every surface, with or without a shell. The operator `CommandMark` is unchanged and stays the
 * shell's mark (§00 — its pack geometry is locked).
 *
 * This REPLACES the retired orbital `PaigeMark` (gold orb + ring + companion spark), owner-ruled
 * 2026-09-06: "Command Mark = current Paige platform/product identity. Legacy orbital PaigeMark =
 * retired and prohibited from active use." The slash-and-orb geometry below is the CD pack's, exact
 * (docs/design-references/cd-packs/super-admin-shell-v3/docs/handoff/design-system-port.md §3),
 * matching the operator mark so the identity is one system (§6).
 *
 * API is a drop-in superset of the retired PaigeMark so migration is a swap:
 * - `className` sizes the whole mark (e.g. `h-8 w-8`), same as before.
 * - `animated` turns on a subtle, reduced-motion-safe breathe (used by the Studio cutscene / hero).
 * - `label` names it for assistive tech; `label={null}` makes it decorative (aria-hidden).
 * - `plated` (default true) draws the recognizable rounded tile the menu/shell render; pass
 *   `plated={false}` for a bare inline glyph (bylines, tiny affordances).
