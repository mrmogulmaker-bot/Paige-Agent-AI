/**
 * The approve/deny card Paige shows before she commits a change (#120).
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS A STRUCTURAL FIX RATHER THAN A RESTYLE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The previous version took `fingerprints?: string[]` — optional — and said so in its own comment:
 * "Optional so a caller that has not adopted the binding still renders; that caller's approvals
 * simply will not open the gate." That is a fully live-looking Approve button that CANNOT execute,
 * and it is exactly what the Solo shell shipped: the owner pressed Approve, the rail ticked, and
 * the chat gate — which only ever honours an echoed fingerprint — was still waiting. Measured on
 * production: 21 of 36 proposals in 30 days were never acted on.
 *
 * So the binding is no longer optional-and-hoped-for. Each action carries its OWN fingerprint, and
 * an action with none cannot render an approve affordance at all — it renders the honest refusal
 * (`cannotApproveHere`) that names where the decision can actually be made. A dead Approve button
 * is now unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged (§13/§70).
 *
 * THE INDEX BUG THIS ALSO CLOSES. The old caller built two parallel arrays and filtered one of
 * them — `items.map(c => c.summary)` beside `fingerprints.map(c => c.fingerprint).filter(Boolean)`.
 * Any action missing a fingerprint shifted every later summary onto the wrong fingerprint, so an
 * approval could be spent on a neighbouring call. Pairing summary and fingerprint in ONE object
 * makes that misalignment impossible to express.
 *
 * Gold discipline (§11): container, icon and headings are neutral; gold is spent only on the
 * Approve act. Focus rings are indigo. One elevation declaration — a hairline border on a tinted
 * surface, never a border under a shadow.
 *
 * Owner-surface only: the client portal never renders operator-approval framing (§6/§9).
 *
 * TWO MODES, ONE CARD (owner-approved recovery design, 2026-09-26). `decide` is the card above:
 * Needs your OK, Approve, Not now. `report` is the same card on the turn that ran the approval: it
 * says Running…, then what became of each action — Done, Didn't run, or Couldn't confirm — in the
 * sentence the server wrote, with the one next step that exists. It never renders an approve
 * control: pressing Approve twice must be impossible, not merely discouraged.
