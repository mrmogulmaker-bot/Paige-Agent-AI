/**
 * PaigeAttribution — the foundational VP-surfacing byline (#243).
 *
 * A small, read-only credit that names which of Paige's VPs/agents actually
 * produced an AI-generated surface (a drafted email, a generated page, a Command
 * Center card, a chat answer). It is a DISPLAY primitive, never a picker.
 *
 * HONESTY (§13). It renders exactly the contributors it is passed — a LIST, never
 * a single hardcoded name. Even if a human @-mentions ONE VP, every real
 * contributor is credited; the component cannot invent a VP that didn't work
 * (unknown `vp` values are dropped, an empty list renders `null`, and names come
 * only from the frozen {@link VP_ROSTER}). It never collapses to a single canned name.
 *
 * NOT A PICKER (§18/§20/§21). There are no tabs, chips, modes, or agent-selector
 * here — it exposes no way for a human to pick or switch a VP or artifact type. It
 * only credits who already worked.
 *
 * GOLD DISCIPLINE (§11). A byline is NOT an act/approve/on moment, so gold is
 * deliberately absent: the lead-in and names are `--foreground`/`font-medium`,
 * the remit line is `--muted-foreground`, the divider a hairline `--border`. No
 * gold text, no gold fill, no StatePill state="on". Token-only (zero hex), AA in
 * both themes via those semantic tokens.
 *
 * NO MOTION. A resting byline is static. The optional {@link PaigeMark} glyph is
 * rendered with `animated={false}` (a byline is not a live/generation moment), so
 * no animation — and therefore no unguarded motion — ships here.
 *
 * TRI-SCOPE (#243). The SAME six VPs serve tenant / operator / portfolio surfaces;
 * `scope` only frames the surface context, it never swaps the roster. The lead-in
 * defaults to the surface-neutral "By your Paige team" and callers override it to
 * match the action (§36 — instantly legible in ~5 seconds: "By your Paige team:
 * Merit + Vera", or leadIn="Drafted by your Paige team" on a drafted email).
 *
 * §2/§9-clean: roster remits are coaching-generic — no finance/credit/vertical
 * wording, no operator-only content — like every other primitive in this layer.
