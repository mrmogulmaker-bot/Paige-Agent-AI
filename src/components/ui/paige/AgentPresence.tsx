 * AgentPresence — the single integration point for the Paige presence chrome
 * (Wave 4 Slice 4a.1). Mounts the docked right-rail + the universal ⌘K launcher and
 * feeds them the account-type-aware persona (spec §5a). Host shells (AdminLayout
 * now; AgencyLayout in a fast-follow) render this once, inside
 * {@link AgentPresenceProvider}, on their AUTH-GATED, non-Studio surfaces.
 *
 * ACCOUNT-TYPE derivation is PRESENTATION-ONLY (§9): it never authorizes anything —
 * the real tenant/operator boundary is server-side (RLS + PlatformStaffOnly). It only
 * picks which chrome/identity the rail shows:
 *   • God / platform tier (no active tenant) → super_admin → "Paige Operator"
 *   • active tenant is a top-level agency/enterprise → agency (scope-switcher slot)
 *   • active tenant has a parent → sub_account (identical rail to solo, spec §5a)
 *   • otherwise → solo
 *
 * VP-persona binding is a SEAM (persona.ts): the default identity is resolved here;
 * a tenant-authored Playbook persona (§7) or a later VP binding overrides via props
 * with NO change to the rail.
