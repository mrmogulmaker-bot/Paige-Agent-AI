 * Agent-presence persona seam (Wave 4 Slice 4a.1).
 *
 * The right-rail + ⌘K launcher are CHROME, not a chat design (agent-ui-placement
 * spec §11 non-goal). This file is the ONE seam where "which Paige persona speaks
 * on this surface" is decided — kept deliberately thin and prop-driven so the real
 * binding can be wired later WITHOUT a refactor of the rail.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SEAM, NOT A HARDCODED ROSTER (open owner decision) ────────────
 * The VP-remit authority is UNRESOLVED: the frozen `VP_ROSTER` (7 ids —
 * PAIGE + 6 VPs, see `@/components/ui/page` PaigeAttribution) and the broader
 * "roster doctrine" disagree on which VP owns which surface/remit. Binding a VP
 * here now would bake that conflict into shared chrome. So {@link AgentPersona.vp}
 * stays OPTIONAL and defaults `undefined`; the rail renders the neutral
 * orchestrator identity ("Paige" / "Paige Operator") until the owner rules and a
 * later slice fills the binding in — a one-line change in {@link resolveAgentPersona}.
 *
 * §2/§9-clean: labels here are coaching-generic and platform-vs-tenant aware — no
 * finance/credit wording, no vertical copy. A tenant's ACTUAL persona name/voice is
 * tenant-authored per Playbook (§7) and layers on top via the `persona` prop the
 * host passes in; this only supplies the platform default when none is provided.
 */

/**
 * Presentation-only account classification the rail adapts to (spec §5a). This is
 * NEVER an authorization signal — the real tenant/operator boundary is server-side
 * (RLS + PlatformStaffOnly, §9). It only picks which chrome/identity the rail shows.
