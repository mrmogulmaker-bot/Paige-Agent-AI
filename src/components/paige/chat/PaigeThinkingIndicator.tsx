// #11 — the shared, surface-agnostic "Paige is thinking" indicator. PROMOTED from the Studio
// ReasoningPanel pattern (useElapsedMs + a live "Thinking… <s>s" tick + a collapsed-expandable
// "Thought process") into ONE component consumed by every Paige chat surface (§18 one home): the
// owner/platform "Your Paige" console, the client portal, the Vibe Studio session, the broker
// session, and the floating widget. No surface hand-rolls its own thinking affordance.
//
// The state machine is driven by props, with an internal wall-clock timer:
//   idle            — no turn in flight → renders nothing.
//   thinking        — a turn is streaming, no answer text yet → "Thinking… Ns".
//   still_thinking  — thinking for longer than `stillThinkingAfterMs` (~10s) → "Still thinking… Ns".
//   writing         — the first answer token arrived → "Writing… Ns".
//   done            — turn finished → renders nothing (the completed reply speaks for itself).
//
// The expandable "Thought process" renders the STREAMED reasoning thoughts passed in (the server's
// `paige_step` frames of kind "thought") — NEVER the verbatim `paige_thinking` channel, which is
// gated off server-side (STUDIO_THINKING_ENABLED=false). If no thoughts stream, the disclosure is
// simply absent — nothing is fabricated (§13).
//
// §11/§23: this is a WATCH surface — it spends ZERO gold; it is calm-power indigo (--ring/--primary),
// never anxious/red/loud. Token-only, AA in both themes, motion-safe: the pulse freezes and the live
// seconds tick stops under `prefers-reduced-motion` (a rapidly-updating counter is motion), falling
// back to a static label. §36: a non-technical coach reads "Paige is thinking / writing" at a glance.
