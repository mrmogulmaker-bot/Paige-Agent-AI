/**
 * The 3D Paige, with the flat presence underneath it as a real fallback rather than a blank.
 *
 * §58 — the owner-approved flat presence is NOT removed. It is what renders when WebGL is absent,
 * when the model fails to load, and when the scene throws. A corner of the Live stage with nothing
 * in it would be a worse outcome than the design that was already approved.
 *
 * §32 — a failure here is LOUD. The cycle this contract exists to break is a boundary that renders
 * null on a throw, so a runtime crash and "it just didn't populate" look identical and cost hours.
 * Every degrade path logs its cause and then shows something.
 *
 * The 3.87 MB model is behind `lazy`, so it is fetched when someone opens Live and never for anyone
 * who does not.
