// The Studio — THE creation surface, one immersive workspace, five outputs.
//
// Dark chrome wrapping a light rendered canvas — the root carries the `dark` token scope,
// so every descendant re-resolves to the dark theme with ZERO hardcoded colors, while the
// LivePreview iframe clones document.documentElement's class (not this wrapper's), so the
// rendered page inside the frame stays in the app's theme + the page's own brand scope.
// Dark studio, light page — and the preview never lies about what publishes.
//
// One studio, four modes: Page (the original Vibe Studio machinery, verbatim), Funnel,
// Form, and the absorbed Content Studio's creative surface — Image. Mode state is kept mounted
// for the session, so switching modes never eats work in progress. (Standalone copy is NOT a
// Studio mode — it's a Paige-chat capability, §18/§21; copy inside a page/funnel/form is an
// embedded-quality property of that asset, not a separate artifact.)
//
// This is the ONLY file in the Studio that drives the page seam layer end-to-end. The
// mode components own their own narrow seams (content-draft, generate-image, the
// form/funnel functions in studio.ts) — every action here is also a function Paige can
// call headlessly (§10).
//
// GOLD (§11): one gold act per mode — the Publish trigger in the top bar (page), Publish
// funnel, Create form — plus the confirm inside
// PublishDialog. Image carries gold ONLY on its manual Save-to-library retry, and only
// when the server's own auto-file didn't happen (§13) — the ordinary path (auto-filed,
// confirmed by a real content_id) shows a plain success StatePill, no button to click.
// Not on Generate, not on Save, not on a chip, not on the selection outline (that's
// indigo `--ring`).
