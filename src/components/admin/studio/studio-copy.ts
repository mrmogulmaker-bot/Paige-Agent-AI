// Every operator-facing string in the Vibe Studio, in one file.
//
// This ships to EVERY tenant by default, so it is the most doctrine-exposed surface in the
// Studio and it lives alone so the §2/§3 audit has exactly one place to read.
//
//   §2  — the audience is client-based service businesses: coaches AND consultants, agencies,
//         advisors, thought leaders. The seed briefs are written so each of them sees
//         themselves. ZERO credit / funding / lending / financing wording — a tenant may
//         CHOOSE to author a funding page, but the platform default must never suggest one.
//   §3  — direct, confident, mogul-founder. Never "AI-powered", "streamline", "seamless",
//         "empower".
//   §11 — no backend codes, table names, or function names ever reach the operator. The error
//         map below is what converts a raw server raise into a sentence they can act on.
//   §15 — the seed briefs are REAL, usable briefs. Not lorem, not [PLACEHOLDER].
