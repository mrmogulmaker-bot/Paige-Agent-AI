     *
     * Binding it to the caller broke two ways. A catch-up deferred behind a
     * load returns `false` to its caller and settles later, so its success
     * never reached the handler that was waiting for it and a caught-up
     * calendar stayed stale. And a catch-up whose channel died again mid-flight
     * still resolved `true`, so the caller cleared a latch that had just been
     * legitimately re-set — reporting LIVE over a dead subscription, the exact
     * false confidence this state exists to prevent.
     *
     * Checking HERE, at the moment the rows arrive, answers both — but health
     * alone is not the test. A load already in flight when the channel came back
     * was read from the wrong side of the gap: it can miss anything committed in
     * the last moments of the outage, and clearing on it would report LIVE over
     * exactly what the latch exists to flag. So the read must ALSO have been
     * issued under the subscription that is still live now.
