/**
 * S6 — the workspace does not advertise what it cannot do.
 *
 * §70.1: "UI that DESCRIBES a capability without allowing its supported human flow" is not
 * delivered. Three claims on this surface failed that test, and each was a statement of fact that
 * happened to be false — not a design opinion:
 *
 *   · the composer offered "@ hand it to someone · / call a skill · # remember". Solo passes no
 *     chips, so the slash menu can never open, and there is no `@` or `#` handling anywhere in the
 *     file. All three did nothing, silently.
 *   · the command field printed ⌘K. The shell binds ⌘/Ctrl+backslash; the global ⌘K owner is
 *     registered only when `launcherEnabled`, which Solo sets false.
 *   · the Capabilities panel said voice input was "Partial / Not activated" while the
 *     hold-to-dictate mic sits live in the composer one tab away.
 *
 * These are source assertions rather than rendered ones on purpose: the claim is that the STRINGS
 * are gone, and a rendered test would pass just as well if the element were merely hidden.
