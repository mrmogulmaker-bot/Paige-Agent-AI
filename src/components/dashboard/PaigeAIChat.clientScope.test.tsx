/**
 * S2 — a client switch ends the conversation, the way an account switch already does.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THESE PIN. `PaigeAIChat` re-POSTs its whole local `messages` array on every turn
 * (see the `messages` payload in `handleSend`). The account-change effect clears that array, so an
 * account switch cannot carry the previous workspace's content forward. There was no equivalent
 * for `clientId`: focusing a different client — or clearing focus entirely — left client A's
 * answers in the transcript, and the next turn shipped them to the model under client B's scope.
 * The backend's client-scope guard authorizes the NAMED client; it cannot know that the prose
 * already in the array is about someone else.
 *
 * Written before the fix and confirmed red: without a scope-keyed reset, assertion 1 finds
 * "Client A private answer" still on screen after the switch.

 * which auto-resumes `threads[0]`; `selectThread` then reaches its release line and drops the
 * focus that was set milliseconds earlier. The person never gets to send a turn under the
 * client they chose.
 *
 * Why every earlier test missed it: they all mock `threads: []`. With no saved conversation
 * there is nothing to resume, so the surface behaves correctly on an EMPTY account and fails on
 * every real one. These tests pin the populated account.
 *
 * Why the release itself is NOT removed: opening a saved owner-level thread while a client is
 * focused really must drop the focus, because that transcript may be about someone else. The
 * repair separates the person choosing a thread (still releases) from hydration restoring one
 * (must not). Written before the fix and confirmed red.
