/**
 * Where a provider's consent redirect lands.
 *
 * This page carries no authority of its own. It reads the two values the provider echoed
 * back — the authorization code and the state — and hands them to `tenant-mcp-connect`,
 * which is where every decision is made: the state is redeemed exactly once in SQL, the
 * PKCE verifier is read server-side, the tenant comes from the stored flow rather than
 * from this browser, and the code is exchanged without either secret ever existing here.
 *
 * A code is single-use and short-lived, so this page must not be re-runnable: React
 * StrictMode mounts effects twice in development, and a second exchange of a spent code
 * fails at the provider. The guard below makes the exchange happen once per mount.
 *
 * Nothing is stored, logged, or put in the URL by this page. The query string is cleared
 * as soon as it has been read, so a copied address, a screenshot or a shared browser
 * history cannot carry an authorization code.
