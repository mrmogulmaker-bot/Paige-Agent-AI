/**
 * The presence classification, tested as a function rather than grepped as a string.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `useSocialCommand` had no executed test at all — the contract suite reads
 * it as source text and asserts with regexes — so `unreadable`, the entire basis of the
 * `handlesUnknown` chain and of two §13 fixes, could be reverted to `refused` and break nothing.
 * The §39 peer-gate proved exactly that. A guard that cannot fail is not a guard, so the decision
 * moved into a pure function and the assertions moved onto its output.
 *
 * The shapes below are the ones `get_social_presence_evidence` actually returns
 * (`supabase/migrations/20261210000000_a_business_can_record_the_accounts_it_posts_from.sql`):
 * one row per network, refused together rather than per-network, with three distinct reasons.
