/**
 * Solo Campaigns → Sales — the contract for the Sales Command Desk.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (§58) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Sales tab ships the platform's §38 money boundary and its only routed-capture read. Nothing
 * else pins them, so a rebuild could delete the surface's honesty and pass every other gate green.
 * This file is that guard: the §38/§59 boundary, the recorded-terms honesty, the readable-vs-none
 * distinction, and the no-summed-total rule are asserted here and must survive any rebuild.
 *
 * ─── WHAT CHANGED IN THE COMMAND-DESK REBUILD (Sales Command Desk, 2026-09-05) ────────────────
 *
 * The single-scroll workbench became FOUR views — Sales Command · Commercial Terms · Revenue &
 * Collections · Sales Scenarios — selected by a Sales-local `?view=` param (the shell six-tab nav
 * is untouched). Every honesty guard below is UNCHANGED in intent; each now renders the view that
 * owns its band. New positive coverage pins the new operating views (pulse evidence classes, the
 * unavailable Contract-pending stage, the tenant-level payment path, and the model-only Scenario
 * Lab). Nothing that shipped was dropped — the routed-capture read, its no-inference drawer, its
 * empty state and its phase-awareness moved INTO SalesOps and are still asserted here.
 *
 * ─── WHY IT IS NOT IN growth2.render.test.tsx ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PR #706 (Solo Pipeline) currently owns `growth2.render.test.tsx`, `growth2.contract.test.tsx`,
 * `solo-campaigns.css` and the Pipeline block of `growth2.tsx`. This slice keeps its diff off all
 * four. A merge conflict in a test file is how a §58 pin gets "resolved" away.

 * offer picker — the one moment a workspace with no catalog is actually blocked by not having one.
 * That is also its ONLY call site in the repo, so had it been dropped rather than moved, the whole
