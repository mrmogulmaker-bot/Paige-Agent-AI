/**
 * Campaigns › Social — the projection contract and the fabrication guard.
 *
 * TWO JOBS, and the second is the one that matters.
 *
 * The first is ordinary: `social-command.ts` is pure, so every figure this surface can show is
 * decidable without a browser. These tests call the builders directly.
 *
 * The second is the guard `src/solo/compass.fabrications.test.ts` exists for, pointed at the surface
 * that most needs it. A dashboard of KPI tiles, progress figures and per-channel cards is precisely
 * the shape that grew ten invented departments, a hardcoded confidence percent and a fabricated
 * week-over-week trend inside `compass.tsx` — and NOTHING in this repo mechanically guarded
 * `growth2.tsx` against the same thing before this file. Two lessons are copied from that file
 * rather than re-learned: assert on the SHAPE, not a bare phrase (a removal note quoting a heading
 * made an earlier assertion vacuous), and COUNT invocations rather than mentions.
 *
 * Comments are stripped before every static assertion — a guard a docstring can trip is a guard
 * that punishes documentation, and this file's own explanations would otherwise match it.
