/**
 * Registration as a SECOND EDITOR of the ONE canonical business record.
 *
 * The defect this file exists to close (§70): Registration tells an owner exactly which
 * carrier-required facts are missing — "tax or registration number, regions of operation,
 * authorized representative" — and then offers no way to supply any of them. The only path
 * is a link that leaves the surface. Reading the code proves the LINK is wired; it never
 * proved a person can FINISH the registration.
 *
 * The rule these tests encode is that a second EDITOR is not a second WRITER (§18/§57).
 * Registration edits the same record Setup edits, through the same canonical seam
 * (`save_solo_business_context`), with the same server-derived tenant, the same revision
 * check and the same Owner-only legal gate. It never writes `tenant_legal_profile` directly
 * and never introduces a parallel save.
 *
 * The most dangerous failure mode here is not a missed field. `save_solo_business_context`
 * REPLACES the submitted knowledge/voice/profile collections and REFUSES an Owner save that
 * omits them ("Complete business context is required for an Owner save"). So a Registration
 * save that fires before the business context has loaded, or that submits empty lists, would
 * destroy the owner's Setup knowledge bucket and Paige brief from a screen that never
 * mentions them. Three tests below exist solely to make that impossible.
