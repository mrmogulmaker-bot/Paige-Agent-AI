/**
 * Campaigns › Social — the Social Command surface.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SURFACE IS FOR. One question, answered in the first few seconds: what is PAIGE doing to
 * grow this business socially right now — and, just as loudly, what she cannot yet see. It is not a
 * scheduler and it is not a placements report, because the platform holds neither for a tenant — and
 * the layout says which of those it is missing rather than leaving a plausible-looking zero where a
 * number would go.
 *
 * THE REDESIGN (owner-commissioned 2026-09-05): "executive mission control meets luxury AI operating
 * system." This is a RESKIN of the honest surface, not a new set of claims. The premium comes from
 * the desk ground, the command-header lockup, the signal cards, the connected pipeline and the
 * token-built eclipse — never from data the backend does not hold. Where the reference draws a
 * capability the platform has no seam for (a live channel connection, a publishing/ad pipeline,
 * measured telemetry), the surface renders the honest absence instead of a dead control.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND. Every figure comes from `social-truth.ts`, where its source
 * and its state were decided in a function a test can call. Nothing is computed inline here, and
 * nothing has a fallback: a module with no source renders its absence and says which record would
 * have to exist. `src/solo/compass.tsx:8-38` is the standing account of what happens when a
 * dashboard of exactly this shape is allowed to fill its own gaps.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES FROM THE PANEL THIS REPLACES (§58). The five non-inferences it made out loud — no
 * accounts, followers, publishing queue, schedules or placements are inferred — are each still made,
 * now attached to the specific tile that would otherwise imply one. Its Vibe Studio redirect and its
 * "placements are recorded by a provider" precondition are both kept. So is the one write.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW. An owner can RECORD the accounts their business posts from, here, and that write is
 * the first one `tenants.features->social_handles` has ever had. Systems Check #3 points at this
 * page; until this slice it pointed at a page that could not finish the job.

   * `unavailable` AND `error`, and `useSoloPendingActions` starts `{items: [], loading: true,

   *
   * In flight is the MOST reachable of those states, not the least. `useSoloCampaigns` issues six
   * round trips where `useSocialCommand` issues two, so on first paint social routinely wins and
   * the page renders with campaign zeros asserted as facts; and its `visibleState` flips to
   * `loading` SYNCHRONOUSLY on a tenant switch, so every switch commits at least one such frame.

   * `!== "ready"` rather than a list of phases, deliberately: a phase added later is unread until
   * someone proves otherwise, which is the safe direction for a §13 flag to fail in.
