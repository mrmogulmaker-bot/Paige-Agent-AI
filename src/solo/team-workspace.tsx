  // destructive action must never have. `inFlight` guards a second CLICK; it never guarded a
  // dismissal. The window is short but it is exactly the window a slow or failing call widens.
  //
  // THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS FIX DID NOT WORK, and how it failed is why this is now ONE function
  // rather than a wrapper at one boundary. It gated only the prop handed to `Modal` — which covers
  // the backdrop, the header X and Escape — but the FOOTER button is rendered by THIS component and
  // wired the raw `onClose` prop directly. So the single control actually labelled "Close" stayed
  // live, and a person trying to back out would click precisely that one. Caught by an independent
  // read of the pushed diff; my own test missed it because it selected the close control by
  // `aria-label`, which the footer button does not carry. Every path now goes through `requestClose`,
  // and the controls are DISABLED rather than live-looking and inert.

  // line left the paragraph above it and BOTH aria-labels still reading `workspace.tenant_name` —
  // which the parent re-supplies as the NEW workspace after a mid-call switch. Three of the four
  // then asserted a destructive act against a workspace it was not happening in while the fixed one
  // said otherwise: the screen contradicted itself, and a screen-reader user heard the wrong claim
  // from the button labels — worse than before, when all four at least agreed. Idle: `nameAtArm` is
  // null and this is the live name, which is right. Armed: a switch disarms, so it cannot go stale.
  const removalWorkspaceName = removal.nameAtArm ?? workspace.tenant_name;
  // THE GATE IS READ THROUGH A REF, because the gate itself was a stale closure — which is how the
  // first version of this fix failed, in the opposite click order. `changePermission` captures
  // `requestClose` at the render where "Confirm access change" was pressed; if the removal had not
  // started yet, that copy holds `removalInFlight === false` and closes the dialog unconditionally
  // when its own RPC resolves — mid-removal, discarding the refusal exactly as before. The note
  // below already named this mechanism for the raw closes, and I failed to apply it one line up.
  // A ref cannot go stale, so every copy of `requestClose`, however old, reads the current state.
  // THE INVARIANT, in both directions: while a removal is in flight NO other write starts, and while
  // any other write is in flight a removal cannot start. `saving` is shared by the work-details save
  // and the permission change, so gating on it covers both — deliberately, not incidentally. This is
  // what makes the interleaving that broke the first version of this gate unreachable rather than
  // merely guarded. (`save()` never closes the dialog, so it was not an escape path; it is included
  // for the invariant, not because it leaked.)
  // Assigned on COMMIT, not during render — the rule this file already states for `Modal`'s
  // `latest` ref 300 lines up, and which I broke here: a render discarded by StrictMode or
  // concurrent rendering would leave this holding `true` against a committed `false`, producing a
  // Close button that looks live and does nothing. `requestClose` only ever runs from an event
  // handler, which is after commit, so reading a commit-assigned ref is correct.
  // NOTE FOR ANYONE TIDYING THIS: the six `onClose()` calls inside `confirmRemoval` are RAW on
  // purpose and must stay that way. They run after the call has settled, but `requestClose` closes
  // over a `pending` state that is still true at that instant (the ref updates on the NEXT
  // render, and these run before it) — so routing them
  // through here would refuse the close and strand the operator in a dialog whose work is done.
  // Every close path a PERSON can trigger goes through `requestClose`; the settle paths are the
  // component deciding it is finished, which is the one case the gate must not block.
  // Closing it yourself acknowledges what is in it, so the safety net must not then repeat it back
  // as a toast. Written through the ref rather than through state because this unmounts in the same
  // batch: a `setRemoval` here may never commit before the component is gone.

      {/* `canRemove` is recomputed from the LIVE roster, so switching into a workspace where the
          viewer is only an Admin used to unmount this entire block MID-REMOVAL — taking the
          "Removing…" status line, Cancel and Confirm with it. What was left was an open dialog
          saying nothing about a destructive act in flight, with ZERO enabled controls: both close
          buttons are disabled while pending (deliberately, so a refusal cannot be lost), the work
          fields are disabled by `!can_manage_profiles`, Escape routes through the same gate, and

          exit. Once a removal is under way this block belongs to the call, not to the live roster —
          it stays until the call settles and the switch guard above closes the dialog properly.

          removal under way in EITHER stage belongs to its call. Stated plainly so it is not mistaken
          for a tested fact — only the pending half is provable, since a switch while merely ARMED is
          unmounted by the parent's stale-selection clear before this gate is reached, and mutation
