/**
 * The Solo Team removal seam, asserted against the migration that defines it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. These are SOURCE-LEVEL assertions on SQL text. They prove the guards
 * are written, and written in the right order; they do not prove the function runs. Runtime proof
 * against a real workspace is a different and stronger class, and it is reported separately rather
 * than folded in here.
 *
 * WHY ORDER IS ASSERTED AND NOT JUST PRESENCE. Every guard here is worth exactly what it is worth
 * BEFORE the DELETE. A refusal written after the row is gone is not a refusal, and "the string
 * appears somewhere in the file" cannot tell the two apart — so each guard's index is compared
 * against the index of the write. Two of them additionally have to precede the target LOOKUP, not
 * merely the write, and that is asserted separately because the reason is different: a not-found
 * message returned to a caller who was never entitled to ask is a membership oracle.
