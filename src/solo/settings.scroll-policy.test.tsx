/**
 * THE TWO HALVES OF THE OWNER'S SCROLL POLICY, LOCKED (2026-08-31).
 *
 *   · Connections/Calendars and Integrations are the authorized visible-scroll
 *     Settings surfaces. Other destinations keep their prior non-visible policy.
 *   · Clients, Campaigns/Growth, Compass, Command Center, Mind and Analytics keep
 *     their form-fitting, design-locked interaction policy. They must NOT become
 *     document-scrollable as a side effect of repairing Settings.
 *
 * The second half is the one that needs a test. A repair that makes Settings work
 * by loosening a SHARED rule silently changes every other surface that rule was
 * holding, and nothing would have caught it: the locked surfaces have no failing
 * assertion of their own, they just quietly start scrolling. An earlier revision
 * of this branch did exactly that — it excluded `[data-solo-screen-host]` from the
 * blanket clip outright, which un-clipped the host on `clients`, `growth` and
 * `compass` too.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. These are source-contract assertions: they
 * prove the SELECTOR cannot reach a non-Settings surface, which is a property of
 * the cascade and is decidable from the text. They do not prove rendered geometry.
 * That is `scripts/live-drive/calendar-settings-usable-drive.mjs` (Settings) and
 * `scripts/live-drive/solo-locked-surfaces-drive.mjs` (the locked surfaces), both
 * driven inside the real merged `SoloApp`. Neither substitutes for the other, and
 * neither is authenticated production proof.
