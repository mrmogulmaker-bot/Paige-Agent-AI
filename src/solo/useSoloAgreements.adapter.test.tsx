// `sales-ops.contract.test.tsx` mocks this hook outright so it can prove the SURFACE. That leaves
// the query shape unproven, so this file drives the REAL hook against a client that RECORDS what it
// was asked for. A dropped tenant filter, a renamed column, a swallowed error, a draft that forgets
// which workspace it was opened in, or a readable flag modelled on the wrong signal turns it red.
//
// The pattern and its reason come from the sibling file: a static `toContain("clients")` passes
// whatever the columns are called and whatever the filter is, so it proves nothing that matters.
