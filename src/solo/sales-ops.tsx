// @ts-nocheck
// Campaigns → Sales — the workspace's SALES OPERATIONS surface.
//
// ─── WHAT THIS TAB IS FOR, AND THE BOUNDARY IT SITS ON ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Settings → Billing is what this workspace pays PAIGE. This tab is the other direction of money
// entirely: what the workspace charges its OWN clients. §38 draws the line and it is absolute —
// PAIGE is never merchant of record for a tenant→client charge, so nothing on this surface
// collects, holds, schedules, or routes money. It records; the money leg runs on the workspace's
// own processor.
//
// Two functions in this repo DO move money and are deliberately never imported here:
// `tenant-checkout-session` (destination charges on Paige's platform account — the live §38
// violation recorded against #458) and `tenant-stripe-connect` (mints a real Stripe Express
// account). Both create external provider state. Everything on this surface is a database record.
//
// ─── CATALOG OWNS THE OFFER. THIS TAB MAKES IT OPERATIONAL. ──────────────────────────────────
//
// There is exactly ONE offer record — `tenant_products`, read through `useCatalogOffers` and
// written through `save_solo_offer`. Sales does not keep a second catalog, a Sales-only SKU, a
// shadow price, or its own offer id (§18). The quick-create below calls the SAME rpc the Catalog
// editor calls and hands the result straight back to Catalog for the full setup. If this file ever
// grows a `products` array of its own, that is the bug.
//
// ─── WHY THE FIGURES ARE SO SPARSE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every number here is a count of rows that exist, and nothing is summed into revenue, forecast,
// or campaign attribution. `tenant_orders` is the only monetary record a Solo workspace has today,
// and an order does not name a campaign — `utm_campaign` lives on `analytics_events` and
// `referral_clicks`, never on the order — so send → click → order does not join. Attribution
// therefore is not shown at all, rather than shown badly (§13).
