/**
 * SoloEntry — the `/solo/*` dispatcher (§65 R3d-i).
 *
 * Mounted at `/solo/*`, always rendering the Solo shell under a nested
 * `:account/*` route so it receives `account` + the branch splat from
 * `useParams()` and drives every tab as a real deep-linkable URL, mirroring
 * `BusinessEntry`'s single-legged pattern (§18 reuse — same shell-conversion
 * pattern as sub-account's `/business/*`, tier-parameterized rather than
 * forked).
 *
 * Like sub-account, there is no legacy standalone board to fork against here
 * — a Solo tenant has only ever rendered inline at `/choose-account` (Admin.tsx's Solo
 * gate), never at its own top-level route — so this dispatcher has a single
 * leg. The `/choose-account` gate's redirect (§58, mirrors Gate A/B) is what makes
 * this address reachable; `SoloApp`'s own top-level ownership guard (§9,
 * mirrors task #171/R3c-i) then keeps the `:account` segment honest against
 * the caller's real tenant.
 *
 * THAT GUARD IS ABOUT THE ADDRESS, NOT THE TIER — which is why the tier gate
 * below exists (owner ruling 2026-09-02). `SoloApp` rewrites the `:account`
 * segment to the CALLER'S OWN account number, so a sub-account or agency caller
 * who reached `/solo/{n}` was quietly renumbered and left running the Solo shell:
 * the right address, the wrong operating mode, with no signal that anything was
 * off. `/business/*` shipped the mirror image of the same hole. Both now ask the
 * one tested question — does this caller's SERVER-DERIVED tier own this shell? —
 * and fail CLOSED to the caller's own root, or to the entry chooser when there is
 * no single home to name, never into another tenant as a convenience.
