/**
 * Campaigns › Social — rendered behaviour.
 *
 * EVIDENCE CLASS, stated up front (§32/§70.1). This is a HARNESS drive against an in-memory double,
 * not authenticated runtime proof. It shows that a person can reach the control, change it, submit
 * it, and be told what the server said — and that every state has something to show. It does NOT
 * show that the RPC accepts the payload on production, and must never be reported as if it did.
 *
 * The idiom is the one every other Solo suite uses: raw `createRoot` + `act`, no testing-library,
 * previous root torn down inside `renderAt` so an orphan tree cannot keep answering queries (the
 * failure `sales-ops.contract.test.tsx:82-86` documents).
