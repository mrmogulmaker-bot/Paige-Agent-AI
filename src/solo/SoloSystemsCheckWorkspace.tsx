/**
 * "Recent activity" — the tenant-wide Rail, made reachable from the Solo Command Center.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Rail's tenant-wide strip (`PaigeRailFeed`) ships inside `PaigeWorkspace`,
 * which `TenantCommandCenterShell` renders ONLY when the Solo workspace is absent — and the Solo
 * shell always supplies it. So that strip is an Agency / sub-account / admin surface, and the
 * tenant-wide rail was dark for every Solo tenant. This mounts the SAME already-deployed read the
 * Trust Compass and Team Activity panels use (`useSoloActivityFeed` → `get_solo_rail_activity`);
 * it is not a second Rail source, and it does not duplicate or re-derive a single event.
 *
 * SAFE FIELDS BY CONSTRUCTION, not by filtering here. `get_solo_rail_activity` returns eleven
 * display columns and `toActivityItem` narrows those to `{id,title,summary,byPaige,departmentSlug,
 * occurredAt}`. There is no payload, ref_table, ref_id, actor_user_id, tenant_id, contact_id or
 * email in the shape at all, so none can reach this markup. `id` is a React key and is never
 * rendered. The feed's `error` string is deliberately NOT rendered either — `status` alone drives
 * the copy — so no server text, SQLSTATE or function name can surface on a tenant screen.
 *
 * FIVE ANSWERS, KEPT APART (§13). Reading `items.length` alone would answer five questions with
 * one sentence: still loading, refused, failed, genuinely empty, and populated. Three of those are
 * not "nothing happened", and two of them would be confident false statements about Paige's work.
 * A refusal therefore never renders as an empty state — it says so, and says so out loud.

   * carries 0/0 on the row while its real findings sit in the table beside it. Production has
   * five such runs right now — one reads `check_count 10, pass 0, fail 0` next to NINE real
   * findings. None is currently the newest for its workspace, so nobody is seeing it today; the
   * moment a run crashes and is the newest, they would.
   *
   * Reading the row regardless would print "0 passed · 0 need attention" directly above a list of
   * things needing attention. So the verdict tallies are ALWAYS derived from the findings actually
   * on screen — the one denominator that cannot disagree with the list under it.
   *
   * That rule used to be applied only to unfinished runs, and the finished case broke it in the
   * other direction. `fail_count` is what the scan saw AT SCAN TIME; resolving a finding afterwards
   * does not rewrite it. So a resolved fail printed "1 needs attention" in this strip while the
   * section below said "Nothing from the last check needs you", with no banner between them to
   * explain the gap — measured directly, and reachable in production, because the resolve path
   * (20260830150343_systems_check_source_integrity.sql:134) permits exactly this status. Deriving
   * both tallies from the findings closes it. On a finished run with nothing resolved they are
   * identical to the run row, so this changes nothing except the case where the row is stale.
   *
   * `check_count` is the one run column that stays trustworthy throughout, because it is written
   * at INSERT (`systems-check-runner.ts:283`, `check_count: rows.length`) rather than patched at the
   * end. An earlier revision of this very comment said all three were patched at the end, which was
   * false and is corrected here.
   *
   * But read it precisely: it is "registry rows THIS RUN SELECTED", not "checks this workspace has".
   * The runner accepts a `runnerKeys` filter (`:239-240`), and `systems-check-run-change` passes a
   * single key per changed surface — so such a run legitimately carries check_count 1. Anything that
