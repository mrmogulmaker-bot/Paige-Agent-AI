/**
 * Drives the REAL Solo chat surface (`PaigeAIChat` with `soloTenantSafety`) into every state of the
 * approval recovery design, through real frames, and writes what it rendered into a page with the
 * compiled Solo tokens, light and dark, so the owner can SEE each state rather than read about it
 * (§00). `scripts/shoot-approval-recovery.mjs` screenshots the pages.
 *
 * PROOF CLASS, stated so it is never over-read: a RENDERED HARNESS — the real component tree, real
 * frames, real compiled CSS — with the network, the tenant and the session stubbed. It is not an
 * authenticated runtime drive of Solo; that is owed, and the evidence record says so.
