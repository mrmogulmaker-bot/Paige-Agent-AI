/**
 * useSocialCommand — the adapter behind Campaigns › Social.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE, and not two more reads inside `useSoloCampaigns`. That adapter is
 * contract-locked at exactly four tenant-scoped reads and asserted read-only
 * (`growth2.contract.test.tsx:74,87`), and the guard is worth leaving sharp rather than editing —
 * the same reasoning `catalog-offers.contract.test.tsx:1-5` and `sales-ops.contract.test.tsx:17-23`
 * record for their own slices. So Social composes that hook's results and adds its own.
 *
 * THE SURFACE AND PAIGE READ THE SAME FUNCTION (§18). Recorded accounts come from
 * `get_social_presence_evidence` — the Spine capability `social.presence` — not from a second query
 * over `tenants.features`. One home means the screen can never show a set of accounts that PAIGE
 * would describe differently in the same session, and a write refreshes both by refreshing one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated so no caller expects otherwise (§13/§38). It records accounts. It
 * does not connect them: no OAuth, no token, no provider API. Nothing here can return a follower
 * count, reach, a queue, a schedule, or a placement, because nothing in the platform holds one for
 * a tenant — see `social-truth.ts` for where each of those absences is rendered.
