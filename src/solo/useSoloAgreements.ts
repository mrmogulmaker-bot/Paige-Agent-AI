// The tenant's CLIENT AGREEMENTS read — Campaigns → Sales, Slice 2.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. Catalog says what the business SELLS. An agreement is the different fact: what ONE
// named client agreed to, on terms that may not be the list terms. This hook reads the agreements,
// the minimum client identity needed to choose one, and whether the caller may write any of it.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
// - It does not read offers. `useCatalogOffers` is the one home for the canonical offer record
//   (§18) and the surface calls it directly, exactly as `sales-ops.tsx` already does. If this file
//   ever grows a `products` array of its own, that is the bug.
// - It does not create, edit or copy client records. The read is SELECT-only and projects six
//   columns, and the agreement row holds a `contact_id` POINTER — never a copied name or email.
//   This is structurally backed rather than promised: the live ACL on `public.clients` is
//   `authenticated=rwdDxtm`, with no `a`, so PostgREST cannot insert a client from here at all.
// - It computes no revenue, no forecast, no attribution, no "performance". An agreement records
//   what was agreed; it observes nothing about whether it was paid, invoiced or delivered, and the
//   status vocabulary has no word for any of those (§13/§38).
