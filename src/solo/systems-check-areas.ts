/**
 * Systems Check — the nine operating areas, and where each real check belongs.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The surface used to group findings by the registry's `domain` column and
 * title-case it, which is why a business owner was shown "Data Product" and "Payments Ops" — our
 * engineering vocabulary, rendered verbatim. The owner ruled the surface speaks in plain business
 * language, so the grouping is authored here rather than derived from a database enum.
 *
 * IT IS A LABELLING LAYER AND NOTHING ELSE. It changes no status, invents no signal, and grants
 * nothing. Every status still comes from the finding the runner actually wrote.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS IF YOU ARE WIRING PAIGE'S TEAM, THE MIND, OR SECURITY. It is your first task there.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three of the nine areas carry `coveredBy: []` and render the status word **NOT CHECKED**:
 * `team`, `mind`, `security`. That word is OWNER-RATIFIED (2026-09-05) and it means exactly one
 * thing: **no check has ever looked at this area.** It does NOT mean something is wrong, and it
 * does NOT mean we looked and could not tell — that is `UNAVAILABLE`, which is a different
 * promise. An absent check is never evidence of a fault, and the surface must never imply it is.
 *
 * SO: when you build the backend for one of those three areas, wiring the feature is only half
 * the job. Until you also give it a check, the owner's console keeps saying NOT CHECKED about
 * something you have just finished building — which is now a lie, and a quiet one, because
 * nothing will fail and no test will complain.
 *
 * The whole job, in order:
 *   1. Add the check to `paige_systems_check_registry` (scope='tenant', enabled_by_default=true).
 *   2. Add its runner under `supabase/functions/_shared/systems-check-runners/`, reading ONLY
 *      tenant-scoped data with an explicit `tenant_id` — the scan runs as service-role with no
 *      user identity, so anything resolving the tenant from `current_user_tenant_id()` will raise.
 *      (That exact mistake is why the revenue check answered nothing for months.)
 *   3. Add the check id to `SystemsCheckId` and to `CHECK_DESTINATIONS` below, with a plain-English
 *      title and a real next action — `systems-check-destinations.contract.test.ts` will fail if
 *      the destination does not resolve to a real route.
 *   4. Move the id into this area's `coveredBy` and DELETE its `uncovered` string. The area then
 *      derives its status from the finding, like the other six.
 *
 * `coveredBy: []` is a deliberate, load-bearing value — do not "fix" it by inventing a mapping to
 * a check that does not grade that area. An area mapped to the wrong check is worse than one
 * honestly marked NOT CHECKED.
 *
 * Check ids, priorities and severities verified against production
 * (`paige_systems_check_registry` where scope='tenant', 2026-09-05). All ten are enabled by
 * default. Adding a check to the registry without adding it here leaves it in `unassigned`, which
 * the surface renders in its own group rather than dropping — a missing map entry must never make
 * a real finding invisible.
