/**
 * useSoloPendingActions — the work Paige has stopped on and is waiting for a person to decide.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Trust Compass ships two modals that describe a decision awaiting the
 * operator. Until now both were literals in the file: an outbound email addressed to
 * `sarah.nnadi@harpervale.com`, with a body, a "why she drafted it" rationale citing behaviour
 * that never happened, and a 91% confidence figure; and a legal escalation stating that a workers'
 * compensation policy "lapsed on August 9", naming a carrier, and recommending a course of action.
 * Approving the first one raised a toast reading "Sent." — a claim that an email had gone to a
 * person who does not exist.
 *
 * That is four of the six things the standing boundary names in two modals: an invented customer
 * record, invented provider state, an invented measurement, and a fabricated successful action.
 *
 * §18 — ONE SEAM. `paige_actions` is the action bus: the row Paige files when work needs doing,
 * carrying its own title, summary, draft, originating department and rationale. `usePaigeDeptStatus`
 * already reads it for the department tiles. This composes the same table rather than inventing a
 * second idea of "what is waiting on you".
 *
 * WHAT "WAITING ON YOU" ACTUALLY IS, read off production rather than assumed. There is no
 * `pending_approval` row in use anywhere; the real shape is `status = 'filed'` with
 * `autonomy_lane = 'confirm'` — filed, and not permitted to run unattended. 117 such rows exist
 * (2026-09-01), against 37 done. A read that filtered on the status name a designer would guess
 * would have returned nothing and rendered an honest-looking empty state over a real backlog.
 *
 * §9 TENANT ISOLATION: the read MUST be scoped to the VIEWED workspace with an explicit
 * `tenant_id = <viewed tenant>` filter — RLS alone is NOT enough here. The live policy
 * `pa_tenant_staff_read` gates SELECT on `tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id() AND a staff role`
 * OR `has_role(auth.uid(),'admin')` — and that second clause is a GLOBAL (tenant-agnostic, §53/§59)
 * operator escape: any holder of the global `admin` role can read EVERY tenant's `paige_actions`.
 * So an unfiltered read on a platform-operator act-as (or any global admin) would surface OTHER
 * tenants' action titles/counts on the viewed tenant's Trust Compass. The caller therefore passes
 * the viewed tenant (the Compass `accountEpoch`) and this hook constrains the query to it; a null
 * workspace runs NO query (never an unscoped read). For a normal tenant admin the filter equals the
 * RLS scope, so it is a no-op there.
 *
 * §13 — WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVIDE, and therefore does not. `paige_actions` has no recipient, no
 * sender, no confidence score, and no list of options. The modals rendered all four. They are not
 * "missing data to be filled in later" — they are claims with no source, so the fields go rather
 * than being defaulted to something plausible.
