/**
 * useSoloActivityFeed — what Paige and the team ACTUALLY did, read from the Rail.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two Solo surfaces presented invented activity as live fact. The Trust
 * Compass rendered a panel headed "Working now — the last few minutes, as they happened",
 * carrying a green "Live" pill over eight lines that were typed into the file: named clients
 * who do not exist, a named recipient, timings down to "4s ago". The Team hub did the same
 * under "What the team did". Neither read anything. A placeholder is one thing; a placeholder
 * under a Live pill, naming customers, is an assertion — and the charter's boundary is exact:
 * do not invent activity, revenue, permissions, provider state, customer records, or
 * successful actions.
 *
 * §18 — ONE SEAM, NOT A NEW QUERY FAMILY. `paige_client_events` is the Rail: the row
 * `record_rail_event` writes, server-side and as the DEFINER owner, whenever something
 * actually happens. This reads it through the SAME deployed resolver `useRailEvents` now uses
 * for a tenant-scoped feed — `get_solo_rail_activity` — rather than standing up a second idea
 * of "what Paige did". If the two ever disagree, one of them is lying, and the way to prevent
 * that is for there to be only one.
 *
 * §9 TENANT ISOLATION. This passes NO tenant_id, and cannot: `get_solo_rail_activity(p_limit)`
 * takes no tenant argument at all. It is `SECURITY DEFINER` and re-enforces the caller's scope
 * in-body (§59) — it resolves the workspace from `current_user_tenant_id()`, requires an active
 * `tenant_members` row of THAT SAME workspace at owner/admin/coach, and otherwise raises
 * `42501 RAIL_FORBIDDEN`. So a sub-account sees ITS OWN activity and never the parent's
 * aggregate, and a role held in another workspace no longer satisfies the gate. The optional
 * `workspaceId` below is used ONLY to notice a switch and to discard a stale answer; it is
 * never sent, so it cannot be used to read another workspace's rail.
 *
 * §13 — WHAT IS LIVE AND WHAT IS DERIVED, field by field, because the file this replaces
 * made no such distinction:
 *   • title, summary        → LIVE   the recorded event, verbatim
 *   • occurred_at           → LIVE   (rendered as an elapsed label, which is derivation, not
 *                                     invention — the instant is real)
 *   • actor_type            → LIVE   paige_agent vs owner_staff. This is exactly what the
 *                                     Team hub's "Paige / People" filter means, so the filter
 *                                     stops being decorative.
 *   • department            → LIVE   from the event's own from/to_department, matched against
 *                                     the seeded §16 slugs. Unmatched resolves to null and the
 *                                     surface says so; it is never guessed from the title.
 *   • tier / "waiting on you" → NOT DERIVABLE HERE and therefore not produced. A Rail row is a
 *                                     record that something HAPPENED; it carries no approval
 *                                     state. Synthesising amber/red from it would re-introduce
 *                                     the exact fiction this hook removes, in a subtler form.
 *                                     Approval state lives in `paige_actions`; a feed that
 *                                     wants it needs that seam named, not a guess.
 *
 * AN EMPTY FEED, A REFUSAL AND AN OUTAGE ARE THREE DIFFERENT ANSWERS. They render identically
 * if you let them, and the second and third both told an operator, with confidence, that Paige
 * had done nothing. `status` names which one it is; `error` carries only the detail.
