/**
 * capabilityTools — the map from the owner-facing capability domains shown on the Trust Compass to
 * the REAL governed tools behind them, and each tool's action-risk class.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The Solo Trust Compass lets an owner set how much Paige may do per
 * capability. The only genuinely tenant-writable governance seam is `set_tool_autonomy` (per TOOL
 * key → `tenant_tool_autonomy.mode`), and the runtime gate `resolve_tool_autonomy` reads it. The
 * owner does not think in 63 tool keys; they think in a handful of capabilities. This file is the
 * one place that grouping lives, so the surface never invents a capability with no real tool behind
 * it, and never offers a control the platform cannot honour.
 *
 * THE RISK CLASS IS NOT DECIDED HERE. It is a property of the ACTION and its one home is
 * `supabase/functions/_shared/action-risk.ts` (§18). This file carries a COPY of the class for each
 * tenant-relevant tool only so the browser can render the knob's ceiling without importing edge
 * code into the app bundle — and `capabilityTools.test.ts` imports the real policy and FAILS if any
 * copied class drifts from it, or if a mapped tool is a ghost the catalogue does not expose. A copy
 * guarded by a test is not a second source of truth; an unguarded copy would be.
 *
 * A CURATED SUBSET, NOT THE WHOLE CATALOGUE. `list_tool_autonomy` is a SHARED contract: it also
 * carries the MCP-door / operator acts (`tenant_create`, `agency_*`, `platform_post_notification`,
 * cross-tenant/privacy acts) that a Solo tenant's Trust Compass must NOT front (§9/§53). So this map
 * deliberately covers only the Solo-capability tools; the test records that subset relationship
 * (mapped ⊂ catalogue) rather than forcing every cross-tier act onto a Solo knob. Extending the Solo
 * surface to newly-catalogued Solo-relevant tools is a scoped §00 product decision, tracked separately.
 *
 * WHAT A RISK CLASS MEANS FOR A KNOB (mirrors the runtime clamp in `paige-ai-chat`):
 *   • ordinary   — the owner may set off / confirm / auto. The full range is real.
 *   • high       — the runtime clamps `auto` down to `confirm` before it ever runs, so offering
 *                  "Acts within guardrails" would be a control the platform neutralises (§70.1 — no
 *                  false affordance). The real choice is off / confirm; the knob caps at confirm.
 *   • owner_only — never performed from an assistant at any approval strength; this is the owner's
 *                  call in Settings, so the knob is read-only ("Your call").
 *
 * The two catalogue rows `pipeline_create` and `pipeline_add_stage` are DELIBERATELY UNMAPPED: they
 * are not real tools (they exist only in a label switch and are `unclassified` in the risk policy,
 * so the runtime refuses them, fail-closed). Mapping them would put a knob in front of an action
 * that can never run. The drift test asserts they stay out.
