/**
 * useSoloGamePlan — the Business Game Plan view-model (§18: COMPOSE existing released,
 * tenant-safe hooks; never a new query family).
 *
 * WHAT IT COMPOSES (each resolves its own tenant from the session — this hook passes NO
 * tenant_id anywhere, §9):
 *   • useCommandCenter        → greeting · approvals · attention · metrics            (LIVE)
 *   • useSoloSetupBrief       → business identity / website / sending identity + per-field
 *                               provenance (owner_confirmed | connection_sourced |
 *                               needs_confirmation) — the honest proof-state signal, reused
 *   • useCatalogOffers        → offers foundation                                     (LIVE)
 *   • useSoloKnowledge        → knowledge foundation (real indexed count)             (LIVE)
 *   • useSoloPendingActions   → work Paige stopped on, waiting on the owner           (LIVE)
 *   • useSystemsCheck("tenant") → readiness findings, the strongest priority signal   (LIVE)
 *   • useSoloActivityFeed     → recorded workspace activity, the durable Rail path     (LIVE)
 *
 * §13 TRUTH RULES honoured here:
 *   • Every visible number has a real numerator + denominator + source (coverage = grounded/total
 *     over the five foundations this hook actually reads; never a fabricated score).
 *   • There is NO goals/priorities store — priorities are DERIVED from real gaps + findings +
 *     waiting work, ranked deterministically, and labelled as derived.
 *   • Work in motion is the recorded Rail feed. An empty *ready* read is "No recorded work yet"
 *     (owner correction 2026-09-05) — never "nothing happened", never a fabricated feed.
 *   • Owner attribution is honest: a setup gap is the OWNER's; a Paige-drafted action or an
 *     at-risk-client move is Paige's (she drafts, the owner approves).
 *   • The view-model carries NO route strings and NO internal identifiers for display — the
 *     component maps a semantic `destination` to a real route/handler, and all copy is plain.
