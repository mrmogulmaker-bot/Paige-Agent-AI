/**
 * useMcpGateway — the Solo-facing binding of the Connected MCP Gateway.
 *
 * SLICE ④ REBIND. Writes that the `mcp-gateway` edge function owns now go THROUGH it
 * (`supabase.functions.invoke("mcp-gateway", { body: { action, … } })`), instead of calling the
 * registry RPCs directly. §18: one door, many actions — this hook connects to that door, it does
 * not build beside it.
 *
 * WHICH CALL GOES WHERE, AND WHY — the honest map (§13). The edge dispatches on `body.action` and
 * today serves exactly five: verify · create · oauth_begin · approve · execute. So:
 *
 *   EDGE (an action exists)         RPC (no edge action exists — kept, never silently removed, §58)
 *   ─────────────────────────       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   createMcp   → create/mcp        rekeyMcp    → set_mcp_connection_endpoint
 *   createRest  → create/rest       rekeyRest   → set_mcp_rest_connection_endpoint
 *   verify      → verify            disconnect  → disconnect_mcp_connection
 *   beginOAuth  → oauth_begin       reads       → get_mcp_connections_v2 + is_current_user_tenant_admin
 *   approveTool → approve
 *
 * The right-hand column is NOT an oversight and NOT a half-finished rebind. The gateway edge has no
 * `rekey`, no `disconnect` and no read action, and those three RPCs are live, granted to
 * `authenticated`, and carry shipped, owner-visible capability. Routing them through a door that
 * does not exist would delete working features to make a diagram tidy (§58). When the edge grows
 * those actions, they move — and this comment is the record of why they had not yet.
 *
 * WHAT MOVING TO THE EDGE BUYS (it is not cosmetic):
 *   - The workspace-switch race is caught SERVER-side. The edge re-derives the tenant from the JWT
 *     and compares it to `expected_tenant_id`, answering 409 `tenant_mismatch`. The direct RPC path
 *     passed `_tenant_id` as a hint, which a writer either raises 42501 on or — for a platform owner
 *     — silently honours as an override. Neither is what a browser switching workspaces wants.
 *   - verify / oauth_begin / approve are edge-ONLY by construction: each needs a service-role read
 *     (decrypt a secret, store a PKCE verifier, read a tool pin) that no browser may ever hold (§59).
 *     Before this rebind the UI could not reach them at all, which is why the surface said
 *     "Sign-in soon" and "Paige will check this tool" instead of doing either.
 *
 * TWO ERROR VOCABULARIES, ONE MAP. The edge answers lowercase, snake_case codes of its own
 * (`tenant_mismatch`, `tool_not_verified`, `expiry_in_past`, …) AND passes the writers' uppercase
 * closed set (`MCP_FORBIDDEN`, `MCP_CREDENTIAL_TOO_SHORT`, `MCP_ENDPOINT_CHANGED`, …) straight
 * through `mapWriterError`. Both land in `ERR` below, so a caller maps one way whichever door the
 * refusal came from. An unknown code degrades to a plain sentence — never a raw code, never a
 * framework string.
 *
 * Truth boundaries (the backend contract, mirrored here so the UI can never over-claim):
 *   - Tenant is resolved SERVER-SIDE. Reads pass NO tenant argument; writes pass the caller's own
 *     `activeTenantId` only as an expected-tenant guard (a foreign id → 409 `tenant_mismatch`).
 *   - Secrets are NEVER returned. The list read gives the endpoint HOST and aggregate counts only.
 *     A last-4 exists transiently in a create/re-key response and nowhere else.
 *   - A newly created / re-keyed row is `pending_verification / unknown` until a verify probe
 *     promotes it. This hook never fabricates a `connected` state.
 *   - The per-connection TOOL LIST is readable via `listTools`, and every judgement in it — whether
 *     consent is needed and why, whether an approval has expired or drifted — is the SERVER's.
 *     This hook renders those verdicts; it never recomputes one. An EMPTY list means the catalogue
 *     has been read and found empty; `observedAt: null` means it has never been read at all. Those
 *     are different facts and the surface must not collapse them into one sentence.

   THE CREDENTIAL FLOOR (INT-153) — a client guard that mirrors the server's rule EXACTLY.

   `_mcp_assert_credential_bundle` (migration 20270332000000:465,485) rejects a bearer or header
   token whose `btrim` length is under 12, raising the closed code MCP_CREDENTIAL_TOO_SHORT. It
   exists so verify.ts's credential-reflection scanner (MIN_SECRET_SCAN_LEN = 12) cannot be slipped
   under by a short secret a hostile server echoes back into the tool catalogue.

   Mirrored here so a person who pastes a short token is told SO, in the field, instead of watching
   a round-trip come back with a refusal. THE SERVER REMAINS THE AUTHORITY — this never widens the
   rule, only reports it earlier.

   SCOPE IS EXACT, and the exactness is the point (§13). The floor applies to `bearer` and `header`
   ONLY. It is deliberately NOT applied to:
     - `oauth`   — the token is provider-minted and verify.ts does not scan it (the migration says so
                   in terms at :505). Gating it here would refuse a provider's own token shape.
     - `api_key` — the n8n REST facet never reaches the bundle helper at all; its writer requires
                   only a non-empty key. A floor here would refuse an n8n key the server accepts,
                   which is a client inventing a rule the backend does not have.

   THE APPROVAL-LIFETIME FLOOR — a UI-to-backend contract, and honestly labelled as one.

   Slice ④ is the first caller of the approve door's optional `expires_at`. The backend's only rule
   is "not already past": the edge pre-filters `expiry_in_past` against its own clock
   (approve.ts:114) and the trigger `trg_mcp_reject_past_approval_expiry` (migration 20270334000000)
   settles it atomically inside the writer's transaction with MCP_EXPIRY_IN_PAST.

   FOUR CLOCKS, NO TOLERANCE. The value is minted on the BROWSER clock (below), pre-filtered on the
   EDGE isolate's clock (approve.ts:114), written under the DB's `clock_timestamp()`
   (20270334000000:45), and spent at execute time against `now()` (20270323000000:228). The platform
   grants a 60-second skew budget elsewhere for exactly this browser-vs-server mismatch
   (`_shared/mcp-oauth.ts` isExpired skewSeconds = 60; `_shared/zoomMeetings.ts` EXPIRY_SKEW_MS) —
   but NEITHER approval check grants any: both are a bare `<=` against the server's own clock, with
   no grace term and no skew allowance anywhere in either expression. So the skew has to be absorbed
   by the FLOOR, because it is absorbed nowhere else. That, not the round-trip count, is the
   dominant machine term.

   (§13 correction, caught by this PR's peer-gate: an earlier draft of this comment quoted
   "exact <=, no skew/grace" from 20270330000000:173 / 20270331000000:196 / 20270332000000:501 as
   though it described the approval checks. It does not — all three are the OAuth ACCESS-TOKEN
   expiry check on `_access_token_expires_at`. The phrase is real and the no-grace conclusion is
   still true of the approval path, but it is true by reading the approval checks themselves, not
   by borrowing a sentence written about a different one. The quotation is withdrawn; the
   conclusion stands on its own citations above.)

   TWO WINDOWS THE FLOOR MUST CLEAR:
     A. Surviving its own write — five sequential round trips between the edge clock check and the
        trigger (current_user_tenant_id, is_current_user_tenant_admin, get_mcp_connections_v2, the
        tool-pin read, get_mcp_connection_secret), then a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` that can block on a
        concurrent endpoint write. The repo's own ceiling for one gateway invocation is 30 s
        (`MAX_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_MS`, execute.ts).
     B. Surviving to FIRST USE — consent is verified only AFTER the runner opens a session to the
        external provider and lists its tools (runner.ts), so the first execute spends up to another
        30 s before it even asks whether the consent is still alive.

   So the absolute machine minimum is ~30 s + 60 s skew + ~30 s ≈ two minutes. A lifetime at or
   under that can be accepted, stored, answered `approved: true`, and be dead at or before first use
   — a consent that authorises nothing (§13).

   THE FLOOR IS 15 MINUTES, which clears that worst case by roughly 7.5× (not, as an earlier draft
   of this comment claimed, by three orders of magnitude — that was true only of the warm happy
   path, and it is the worst case that decides a floor). It also leaves ~13 minutes of real human
   think time, because the owner approves a tool IN ORDER TO USE IT: a floor that only protects the
   machine has not protected the person. It keeps a genuine tight-leash lane alive, which §68 wants.
   And it is not a novel number — `analytics_evidence_bundle` already uses a 15-minute human-usable
   window (20261004000000:382).

   THE DEFAULT IS 24 HOURS and THE MAXIMUM IS 30 DAYS, both borrowed rather than invented:
   `set_trust_posture` already defaults a time-boxed grant of elevated authority to
   `_hours int DEFAULT 24` (20260929000000:105 — the function is `set_trust_posture`; an earlier
   draft of this comment and of the Slice ④ commit message called it `set_trust_session_posture`,
   which exists nowhere in the repo), and §68's `trust_attestation_window` gives 30 days
   as the longest window for any rung at which anything acts unread (20261001000000:93-96).

   THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO "UNTIL I REVOKE IT" OPTION, for two independent reasons:
     1. §68 — no authority is permanent. The approvals column comment invokes §68 by name
        (20270323000000:59), and the platform already refused this exact option in code for
        postures: "A posture ALWAYS expires … it is why there is no 'until I clear it' option"
        (20260929000000:131-132).
     2. THERE IS NO REVOKE TO NAME. No per-tool revoke RPC exists and the edge dispatches no
        `revoke` action; every `DELETE FROM mcp_connection_approvals` in the schema is
        CONNECTION-scoped (the endpoint-change trigger, both endpoint setters, disconnect). So
        `expires_at` is the ONLY per-tool withdrawal mechanism that exists today, and offering "no
        expiry" would make the sole way to withdraw one tool's consent opt-out — the owner picks it,
        later wants that tool withdrawn, and finds no control (§70.2). A per-tool revoke is named in
        the close-out as the larger gap.

   THE HONEST LIMIT OF THIS CONTRACT (§13/§60). The server enforces only `> clock_timestamp()`. The
   15 min / 24 h / 30 days shape holds at the UI layer only, so an RPC caller, a script, or a future
   surface can still write a shorter lifetime. It is a product contract this hook keeps, NOT a
   security boundary — do not describe it as server-enforced anywhere. Moving it into the trigger is
   one line, but it NARROWS the writer's accepted contract, so §37 requires a producer inventory
   across all eight caller classes first. Named in the close-out, not done here.
