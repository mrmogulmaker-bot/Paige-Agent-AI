/**
 * A workspace's own MCP connection, per provider.
 *
 * READS come from `get_tenant_mcp_connections`, which returns state only: whether a
 * connection exists, whether it is enabled, its status, its transport, and the last four
 * characters of the credential. It never returns the server URL or the credential, and it
 * never returns the provider's own error text — so there is no path by which any of that
 * can reach a browser, whatever this file does.
 *
 * WRITES go through the `tenant-mcp-connect` edge function rather than straight to the
 * setter RPC. That is deliberate: saving a row proves nothing, and the setter therefore
 * writes `pending_verification`. Only the edge function, which holds the service-role
 * probe writer, can make a real MCP request and move the row to `connected`. Calling the
 * RPC directly from here would leave every connection stuck unproven — and, worse, would
 * let the surface imply a working connection it had never tested.
 *
 * THE CREDENTIAL IS WRITE-ONLY. It is passed as an argument, sent, and dropped. It is
 * never held in this hook's state, never logged, never echoed into an error, and never
 * returned by any read.
