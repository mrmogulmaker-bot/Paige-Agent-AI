/**
 * The pure half of the pending-actions read — what a filed action is allowed to claim once the
 * two fabricated modals stopped claiming it for themselves.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT OF THIS FILE (§13/§32): `TcApprove` and `TcEscalate` are module-private and only
 * reachable by clicking an orb on a WebGL-ish canvas, so unlike `TrustCompass` and `TeamHub` they
 * are not mount-tested. What is covered here is the coercion they render from, plus source
 * assertions in `compass.fabrications.test.ts` that the invented content is gone. Driving the
 * modals themselves is owed to a session that can drive the surface.
