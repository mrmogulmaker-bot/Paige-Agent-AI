/**
 * The invitation lifecycle, driven as an operator drives it.
 *
 * WHAT THE OWNER REPORTED, and what was actually true. A revoked invitation sat in the list for
 * ever with no action on it, and nothing anywhere could say whether the email had been sent,
 * delivered, opened or clicked. The screenshot showed "Revoked" beside "0 pending" — so it was not
 * a stuck pending invite, it was a finished one with nowhere to go.
 *
 * The three grounded facts these tests are built on:
 *   1. `send-portal-invite` returned `emailed: res.ok` — "the POST was accepted" — and threw away
 *      the Resend message id, the only handle a later delivery event could be matched by.
 *   2. `email_send_log` already existed, written by eight other edge functions. This path skipped it.
 *   3. Resend had ZERO webhooks configured while open and click tracking were already ON for the
 *      sending domain, so the events existed and nothing was listening.
