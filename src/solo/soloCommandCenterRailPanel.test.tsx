/**
 * "Recent activity" in the Solo Command Center — the tenant-wide Rail, made reachable.
 *
 * WHY THIS PANEL EXISTS, and therefore what these tests are for. The Rail's tenant-wide strip
 * (`PaigeRailFeed`) ships inside `PaigeWorkspace`, which `TenantCommandCenterShell` renders ONLY
 * when the Solo workspace is absent — and the Solo shell always supplies it. So the tenant-wide
 * rail was structurally dark for every Solo tenant: the safe reader was deployed, the consumers
 * were repaired, and a Solo owner still had no surface that showed it.
 *
 * These drive the REAL component through a mocked supabase client, so the assertions cover the
 * whole path — panel → `useSoloActivityFeed` → `get_solo_rail_activity` — rather than a stubbed
 * hook that would pass whether or not the mount is wired to the deployed reader.
 *
 * The five answers are the point. Reading `items.length` alone answers five questions with one
 * sentence: still loading, refused, failed, genuinely empty, populated. Three of those are not
 * "nothing happened", and two of them are confident false statements about the tenant's own work.
