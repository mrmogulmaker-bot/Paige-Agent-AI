/**
 * Systems Check → every finding's exit must land somewhere real.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The owner's requirement for this surface was explicit: every item needs "a direct next action
 * into the real owning surface", and "no generic 'open PAIGE for more' as the only exit". So the
 * console renders a deep link per finding — "Campaigns › Sales", "Clients › People" — built from
 * CHECK_DESTINATIONS in ./systems-check-areas.
 *
 * The danger is that a WRONG link is invisible. `/solo/*` is a splat with no catch-all: SoloApp
 * resolves the branch with `branchBySlug("solo", urlBranchSlug)?.key ?? "home"` (SoloApp.tsx:141),
 * so an unrecognised branch renders Command Center with the wrong URL still sitting in the address
 * bar. Nothing 404s. Nothing throws. The owner clicks "Campaigns › Sales", lands back on the
 * dashboard he was already looking at, and there is no signal anywhere that the exit was dead.
 *
 * A rename in tierBranches.ts is therefore enough to silently sever every exit on this surface
 * while leaving the whole suite green, because no test anywhere else reads these paths. This file
 * is the guard: it asserts each destination against the routing registry itself, so the registry
 * and the console cannot drift apart without CI saying so.
 *
 * These are the paths the console actually renders, resolved through the same functions the router
 * uses — not a transcribed copy of them, which would drift in exactly the way this exists to catch.
