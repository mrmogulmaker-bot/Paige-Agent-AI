/**
 * Completing the carrier record from Registration — the SECOND EDITOR of ONE record.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `comms-a2p-register` refuses to file a brand until `missing_profile_fields`
 * is empty, and Registration has always printed that list. What it offered against it was a
 * link to Setup. So the surface that knows exactly what is blocking the filing was the one
 * surface that could not unblock it — the owner read "Missing: tax or registration number,
 * regions of operation, authorized representative", left, hunted the same facts across a
 * five-subtab Setup surface, and came back to find out whether he had picked the right ones.
 * Naming a blocker is not resolving one (§70).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SECOND WRITER. The temptation here is a small local save. That would
 * create two records that drift, which is the failure the owner named. Instead this mounts
 * the SAME adapter Setup mounts (`useSoloBusinessContext`) and submits through the SAME
 * canonical seam (`save_solo_business_context`) — server-derived tenant, expected-tenant
 * check, expected-revision check, Owner-only legal gate, one readback. Registration edits
 * Setup's record; it does not keep its own (§18/§57).
 *
 * THE DANGEROUS PART, STATED PLAINLY. For an Owner caller, `save_solo_business_context`
 * REPLACES the knowledge sources, Paige profile and voice examples it is given, and REFUSES
 * a save that omits them ("Complete business context is required for an Owner save"). A
 * registration screen that submitted its own idea of those collections would silently
 * delete the owner's knowledge bucket and brand voice — content this screen never mentions
 * and its user is not thinking about. So the loaded collections are passed through verbatim,
 * and the save is refused outright until the canonical record has actually been read. The
 * guard is not defensive coding; it is the difference between an edit and a deletion.
