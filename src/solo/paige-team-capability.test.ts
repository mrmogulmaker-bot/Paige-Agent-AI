/**

 *
 * Two kinds of assertion live here and they are deliberately not mixed up. The first block runs
 * REAL CODE: `action-risk.ts` is imported and called, so what it says is what production says. The
 * second block reads the handler's SOURCE, because the chat handler is a Deno edge function with a
 * network-shaped entry point and no seam this suite can drive. That is a weaker class of proof and
 * it is labelled as such — it catches a call site wired to the wrong client, which is the mistake
 * that would actually be made here, and it cannot tell you the function runs.
