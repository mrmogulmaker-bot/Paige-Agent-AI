// SCOPE, STATED SO NOBODY HAS TO INFER IT. This slice READS. It creates nothing, changes nothing
// and charges nothing. The governed create/update/activate/pause/archive/restore seam is Slice 2B;

// VOCABULARY PROVENANCE. Product/Service, the delivery shapes, the four lifecycle states and the
// price-presentation set are the owner's Gate 1 ruling. The card anatomy — kind glyph, name and
// summary, state pill, price line, the honest em-dash for an unstated price — is ported from the
// delivered pack (`PAIGE Super Admin Shell v3.dc.html` L458-L523) and its operator implementation
// (`src/operator/surfaces/campaigns/CatalogSurface.tsx`), so the two tiers read as one product.
// The two glyph paths below are the pack's own, verbatim from `paige-ia.js` L789-L790.
