/**
 * social-truth — the projection layer behind Campaigns › Social.
 *
 * Named for `marketplace-truth.ts`, the repo's existing model-beside-a-surface pair, and named
 * DISTINCTLY from `social-command.tsx` on purpose: a model at `social-command.ts` beside a surface
 * at `social-command.tsx` makes `import ... from "./social-command"` resolve to the model, which is
 * exactly the undefined-component failure that caught this.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE, PURE MODULE. The surface it feeds is a dashboard: a hero brief, five KPI
 * tiles, mission rows, an intelligence feed, a six-stage pipeline and per-channel cards. That is
 * precisely the shape that has cost this repo the most — `src/solo/compass.tsx:8-38` records ten
 * invented departments, a hardcoded confidence percent and a fabricated week-over-week trend being
 * torn out of exactly this kind of layout. So every figure this surface can show is decided HERE,
 * in functions a test can call without a browser, and each one carries the state that says whether
 * a real tenant-scoped record produced it.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES: a module with no source renders its absence, never a plausible
 * number. `null` is the value; the note says why. There is no default, no placeholder, no seed.
 *
 * §38 CAPTURE-ONLY. Declared handles are what the business SAYS its accounts are. They are not a
 * connection, and nothing here may present them as one — no follower count, no reach, no schedule,
 * no placement is derivable from a handle, and each of those absences is stated rather than filled.

 * What a figure says when its SOURCE has not been successfully read.

 * loads. This means "the record may well exist; I do not have it and I am not going to guess."
 * Both render an em-dash, and saying the wrong one is how a missing read becomes good news.
 *
 * THE WORDING COVERS THREE STATES ON PURPOSE, and the second §39 peer-gate is why. The first fix
 * here keyed on `phase === "error"` — it fixed the PREDICATE and not the CLASS. A read still in
 * flight, a workspace whose record the caller may not see, and a read that errored all produce the
 * identical all-zeros input, and on this surface the in-flight one is the MOST reachable of the
 * three, not the least: `useSoloCampaigns` issues six round trips to `useSocialCommand`'s two, and
 * flips itself to `loading` synchronously on every tenant switch. "Has not been read" is true of
 * all three; "could not be read" was true of only one. Which state it is stays visible where it
 * belongs — the panel beside the figure shows a skeleton, or an error with a retry.
 *
 * One home for the sentence (§18) because it now appears on seven figures across three builders,
 * and a phrasing that drifts between them would read as several conditions rather than one.
