// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN HOOK AND NOT A FIFTH READ INSIDE `useSoloCampaigns`.
// `growth2.contract.test.tsx` asserts that the campaigns adapter performs EXACTLY four
// `.eq("tenant_id", activeTenantId)` reads. That assertion exists to prove the adapter fails
// closed on tenant identity, and it is worth keeping sharp — a test that has to be edited every
// time a read is added stops being a guard. Offers are a different domain (the tenant's
// commercial record) from published creative artifacts (Vibe Studio's output), so they get their
// own adapter carrying its own identical fail-closed guard, and the existing assertion is left
// untouched. `catalog-offers.contract.test.tsx` asserts the same discipline over this file.
//
// It also keeps the diff off `useSoloCampaigns.ts`, which PR #706 currently owns.
//
// TRUTH BOUNDARY (§13). This reads what the tenant has recorded. It does not compute revenue,
// stock, conversion or demand, because none of those exist. A price recorded here is a PRESENTED
// price, never a checkout: tenant checkout is unreachable in production today.
