// Sales Command Desk — the honest derivation (Campaigns → Sales).
//
// WHAT THIS IS. A PURE function that turns the four commercial reads a Solo workspace already has
// — recorded terms (`tenant_client_agreements`), recorded payments (`tenant_orders`), open pipeline
// deals, and the declared payment handling — into the Sales Command view-model: the Commercial
// Pulse, the Commercial Readiness Ladder, the Top Commercial Moves, and the Open Commercial Work.
//
// WHY IT IS PURE AND SEPARATE. Every figure on Sales Command is a claim about money or commitment,
// so every figure has to be traceable to a real record (§13/§38). Keeping the derivation out of the
// component makes each rule inspectable and unit-testable against fixtures, and makes it impossible
// for a figure to appear on the surface without a rule here that produced it from a real field.
//
// THE TRUTH BOUNDARY, ENCODED (owner build acceptance criteria, 2026-09-05):
//   - "Contracted" is the sum of RECORDED ACTIVE terms — never signed legal agreements. Recurring is
//     reported as a monthly-equivalent, NOT annualized into a single contracted figure it does not
//     prove.
//   - "Actual received" is NOT derived here at all. There is no connected payment source and
//     `tenant_orders` is never summed into revenue; the surface renders it unavailable.
//   - "Contract pending" and any deal↔term linkage are UNAVAILABLE — there is no contracts/Vault
//     foundation and no `deal_id` on an agreement. The ladder says so rather than fabricating a link.
//   - A pipeline deal carries NO monetary value (the mapped `PipelineDeal` has no amount), so no deal
//     value is ever shown.
//   - Deals and terms are NOT linked. The ladder is therefore a READINESS OVERVIEW drawn from three
//     independent record sources, not one opportunity threaded across six stages. The header copy
//     says this; the derivation never pretends a col-1 deal "becomes" a col-3 term.
