/**
 * INT-178 — PAIGE can see a workspace's agreements, and cannot see their signing evidence.
 *
 * Two things are under test and they are different in kind:
 *
 *   1. REACH — the capabilities are registered, valid, read-classified, and bound to Chat. Before
 *      this slice `PAIGE_SPINE_CAPABILITIES` held ZERO agreement entries while `registry.ts`
 *      carried a comment saying three of them registered there. A test that only asserted "the
 *      registry validates" would have passed against that, which is why the assertions below are
 *      about the entries EXISTING, not merely about the array being well-formed.
 *
 *   2. CONTAINMENT — signer evidence never crosses into a tool result. That is asserted
 *      structurally (the projection is an allowlist) AND adversarially (a row carrying every
 *      forbidden field is fed in, and the output is searched for each one). The adversarial half
 *      matters because the RPC is due a widening — `docs/delivery/int162-attachment-map.md`
 *      documents it as accepted and owned by the backend lane — and a delete-list projection would
 *      pass today and leak the moment that landed.
