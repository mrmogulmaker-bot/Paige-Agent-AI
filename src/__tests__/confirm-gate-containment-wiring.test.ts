/**
 * P0 — consequential-action confirm gate: batch repair + honest containment (2026-09-13).
 *
 * The edge handler `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` cannot be unit-executed (Deno + a live Supabase client),
 * so these are SOURCE-ASSERTIONS over the shipped handler — the same proof class as
 * task-thread-link-wiring.test.ts. They pin that the three fixes are wired as designed and that the
 * hard invariants are not weakened. The PURE decision primitive (confirmIdentityValue) is proven
 * behaviourally in confirm-fingerprint.test.ts; the authenticated end-to-end battery (benign
 * dismissal, batch resolve, expired/replayed/forged/cross-tenant, receipt/Rail, no-outbound) is
 * PROOF OWED against the deployed surface (§32.c) — recorded, not faked.
