/**
 * THE GOVERNED MCP DOOR, tested as a matrix over the REAL catalogue rather than a handful of cases.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DRIVEN FROM THE POLICY AND WHY THE COUNTS ARE STILL WRITTEN DOWN.
 * Every case below iterates `MCP_CAPABILITY_POLICY`, so adding a tool without a decision is
 * impossible to miss. That alone would be circular — a test that derives its expectations from the
 * thing under test agrees with anything — so the numbers that MATTER are pinned as literals: 119
 * tools, 51 reads, 68 mutations, 67 `approval_required`, exactly 1 `owner_only`. Emptying the
 * policy, flipping an effect, or quietly reclassifying a send breaks an arithmetic assertion here
 * before it can reach production.
 *
 * REAL CODE, NOT A DOUBLE. `decideMcpToolCall`, `decideGovernedExecution`, `classifyAction` and the
 * capability policy are the shipped modules. What this file asserts is what the door does.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE (§13/§32). This exercises the DECISION and the SHAPE of the chokepoint's
 * source. It is not authenticated runtime proof against the deployed function; that is a separate
 * evidence class and it is owed, not claimed.
