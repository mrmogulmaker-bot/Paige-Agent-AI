/**
 * The CRM patch schema agrees with the database that enforces it.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT, on production 2026-09-25. The owner asked Paige in live Solo chat to add a contact
 * — John Coleman, at a heating and cooling company, with a Chicago street address — and pressed
 * Approve. The approval was claimed correctly. Then the executor threw at 17:37:52.303Z:
 *
 *     CRM_PATCH_FIELDS_INVALID:company_name,zip
 *
 * Paige had sent `company_name` and `zip`. The executor accepts `entity_name` and `zip_code`. She
 * had no way to know, because the tool definition described `patch` as a bare `{type:"object"}`.
 *
 * These tests validate with a REAL JSON Schema validator (ajv) rather than asserting the shape of
 * the schema object, so what is proven is the behaviour a provider enforces at the tool boundary:
 * the owner's literal failing payload is REFUSED before it can reach the database, and the
 * corrected one is accepted.
