// Two halves, because two different things can be wrong:
//   1. The MAPPING — does each of the four acts' real error codes land in an outcome whose
//      owner-facing sentence is TRUE? This half runs the real module.
//   2. The WIRING — is the recorder reachable from both the result path and the throw path,
//      and is it holding the service-role client? `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` is an 11k-line
//      `serve()` handler that cannot be imported, so this half asserts on its source. That
//      is weaker than execution and is stated as such: it catches the exact regressions
//      that make this feature silently write nothing.
