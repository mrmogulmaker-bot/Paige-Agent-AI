/**
 * PR-A — P0 legacy contact delete tenant-isolation remediation.
 *
 * The legacy `delete-contact` edge authenticated the caller, checked a GLOBAL
 * `user_roles` admin/owner row, and then ran a cascading service-role delete
 * keyed only on the body `contact_id` — no tenant predicate anywhere. A
 * tenant-A user holding a global role row could hard-delete tenant-B contacts
 * with their deals, memory, documents and coach rows.
 *
 * The governed canonical delete already existed and is adversarially proven in
 * `supabase/tests/governed_crm_commands.sql` (143 pgTAP assertions, wired into
 * `paige-spine-contract.yml`): service-only executor, active-account match,
 * tenant-scoped owner/admin role, operator-card approval channel, autonomy
 * gate, preview binding with dependency snapshot, tenant-predicated delete,
 * absence readback, idempotent replay, Rail receipt.
 *
 * This contract enforces the retirement decision: Option A — the legacy edge
 * and its tombstoned Chat tool are REMOVED, not hardened in parallel, and the
 * deploy workflow deletes the retired function at the provider (source
 * deletion alone does not undeploy). The one canonical delete path is
 * `contact.hard_delete` behind `crm-command`.
