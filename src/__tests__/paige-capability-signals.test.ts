// Piece 3b — the capability SIGNAL builder + decision core, the manifest Paige answers "what can
// you do here?" from (§13/§36/§70). Two honesty directions are pinned here:
//   - ANTI-OVER-CLAIM: an action whose governed seam is NOT registered / not wired into chat (social
//     publish, SMS send, team manage, skills-in-chat, secure browser) resolves to "planned" — Paige
//     says it's not something she can do here yet, never implies she can, never claims it doesn't exist.
//   - ANTI-UNDER-CLAIM (the 2026-09-12 completion): the genuinely-governed chat capabilities that were
//     previously omitted — research, document creation, save-to-knowledge, planning, delegation — are
//     modeled now, each grounded in its real lane / provider signal.
//
// Tested on the REAL pure modules loaded through the transpile port (both import ONLY types).
