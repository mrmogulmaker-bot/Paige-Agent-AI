/**
 * The Chat CRM door's approval narrowing — wiring proof (2026-09-25).
 *
 * The edge handler `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` cannot be unit-executed (Deno + a live Supabase
 * client), so these are SOURCE-ASSERTIONS over the shipped handler — the same proof class as
 * confirm-gate-containment-wiring.test.ts. The RESOLUTION ORDER itself, which is where the defect
 * lived, is proven BEHAVIOURALLY in crm-approval-resolution.test.ts against the real shared module.
 * What is pinned here is that the door hands the right rows to that resolver, keeps every predicate
 * that bounds what is claimable, and fails closed and loudly when the lookup breaks.
 *
 * The authenticated end-to-end drive (approve a create on the live Solo chat and read the contact
 * back) is §32.c PROOF OWED against the deployed surface — recorded, not faked.
