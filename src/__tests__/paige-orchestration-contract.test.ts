/**
 * Layer C · C4 — the reusable, connector-neutral ActionAdapter CONTRACT conformance suite
 * (`_shared/paige-orchestration/adapters.ts`).
 *
 * C1 built the ledger + monotonic RPC, C2 the native adapter, C3 the n8n adapter. C4 LOCKS the reusable
 * contract itself: the promise that "the engine, the ledger, and the governed pathway never change — every
 * new connector plugs in by REGISTERING an adapter" (owner directive: connector-neutral). These invariants
 * are proven UNIFORMLY across EVERY registered adapter, so adapter #3 (Zapier / Slack / Teams / Google …)
 * cannot silently violate the contract:
 *
 *   1. KIND RESOLUTION round-trips — an adapter's own action_kind resolves to its kind; an unknown kind is
 *      "unsupported" and `adapterForAction` FAILS CLOSED to null (never a silent success — §13).
 *   2. resolveCapability is EXACT — non-null for a kind the adapter owns (valid effect; a mutation carries a
 *      non-empty outcome channel), and null for a foreign kind (an adapter never claims a kind it does not own).
 *   3. ONE LEDGER — every adapter's mutation names the SAME governed channel, `paige_act_executions` (C4's
 *      "one paige_act_executions ledger" requirement, proven at the contract seam, not by convention).
 *   4. STATE SEMANTICS — the DispatchResult.outcome union is a SUBSET of the canonical outcome vocabulary, so
 *      no adapter can ever return an outcome the ledger domain would reject at write time.
