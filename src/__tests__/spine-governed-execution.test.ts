/**
 * The shared governed execution seam, tested as a set of PROPERTIES rather than a set of cases.
 *
 * The property that carries the slice is door-blindness: a capability must not become more
 * permitted because an automation, an agent, a skill or an MCP client asked for it instead of Chat.
 * That is asserted exhaustively — every door, every fixture, byte-identical decisions — rather than
 * by spot-checking one alternative caller, because a spot check passes against an implementation
 * that special-cases the two doors nobody happened to test.
 *
 * REAL CODE, NOT A DOUBLE. `classifyAction` and `decideToolConfirmation` are the shipped modules,
 * and the tool names below are real entries in `action-risk.ts`, so what this file asserts is what
 * production policy says. `crm_delete_contact` is `high`, `crm_create_contact` is `ordinary`,
 * `automation_set_grant` is `owner_only` — asserted directly at the end, so a reclassification
 * breaks this file loudly instead of silently turning its cases into vacuous ones.
