# UI delivery evidence: INT-102 composer scope state machine

UI_DELIVERY_EVIDENCE_VERSION: 1
FLOW_BY_FLOW: PASS: the complete Flow-by-Flow skill and routed references were read; the affected-flow packet below covers typed/dictated draft entry, history resolution, thread/account/user transitions, send/retry completion, and exits
PAIGE_UI_DESIGN: PASS: the complete PAIGE UI Design skill, doctrine, modules, accessibility checklist, and review protocol were read; this repair changes no visual design, layout, token, hierarchy, or interaction affordance
MATERIAL_FLOW_CHANGE: YES: owner-approved INT-102 changes unsent text from one shared composer value into session-memory drafts owned by a complete tenant + user + conversation scope, with explicit non-writable transition states
FLOW_PROTOTYPE: PASS: the owner-approved 2026-09-21 Option 2 contract memo and the deterministic transition table below are the flow prototype; they specify every state, transition, write gate, and completion consequence without inventing a new visual treatment
PURPOSE_AUDIENCE_PRIMARY_ACTION: PASS: a signed-in PAIGE user can write in one conversation, move elsewhere, and return without losing words or seeing them in another tenant, user, or thread
VISUAL_DIRECTION: PASS: preserve both existing composer designs and controls exactly; only their enabled state, truthful existing status region, and in-memory value source change
AUTOMATED_EVIDENCE: PASS: focus-contract test-first head 2f4b5a7dd produced ten named failing assertions against the pre-repair implementation; completed affected-flow verification passes 11 files / 127 tests; forcing both focus fields to `none` then fails 4 / 44 focused tests, while restoring the shared-handle focus passes 44 / 44
STATIC_EVIDENCE: PASS: focused ESLint has 0 errors (one pre-existing hooks warning), the TypeScript ratchet holds at baseline 12/current 12, regression lint, production build, and git diff whitespace check pass; PR diff has zero files under supabase/ and does not touch MessageAudioButton
RENDERED_EVIDENCE: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated browser or preview drive was available before review; no visual or layout rule changed
BEHAVIORAL_EVIDENCE: PASS: jsdom integration tests drive both composer mounts through unresolved identity/history, thread hydration, tenant/user switches, late dictation, lazy thread creation, terminal stream completion, failure, Retry, and edit preservation
AUTHENTICATED_RUNTIME: UNVERIFIED: production deployment and authenticated interaction have not occurred; session-memory restoration and account/thread switching remain production proof owed
KEYBOARD_FOCUS: UNVERIFIED: native textarea/button keyboard semantics and existing focus calls are unchanged and statically inspected, but no authenticated browser keyboard drive was performed
ZOOM_REFLOW: UNVERIFIED: no rendered 200% zoom/reflow drive was performed; no geometry or CSS changed
REDUCED_MOTION: PASS: no animation, motion, or transition behavior changed
STATE_COVERAGE: PASS: identity-unresolved, history-unresolved, hydrating, ready-new, ready-thread, busy, explicit New, automatic resume, controlled selection, load failure, lazy persistence, sign-out, account/effective-user change, client A-to-B, mission A-to-B, clear focus, saved-thread focus release, View-as-Client tenant resolution, mid-stream scope switches, dictation delivery, send, truncated stream, and all four Retry/edit outcomes are covered
TRUTHFUL_STATE_LABELS: PASS: a composer is writable only with a complete displayed scope handle; unresolved/loading/switching states use the existing status region and no failed/truncated response clears the retained draft
SOLO_UI: YES: the canonical Solo PAIGE workspace composer is affected, alongside the AppShell PaigeChat composer
SOLO_1536X770_PAIGE_CLOSED: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; shell geometry is unchanged
SOLO_1536X770_PAIGE_OPEN: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; component behavior is structurally covered
SOLO_1366X768_PAIGE_CLOSED: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; shell geometry is unchanged
SOLO_1366X768_PAIGE_OPEN: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; component behavior is structurally covered
SOLO_1024X768_PAIGE_CLOSED: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; shell geometry is unchanged
SOLO_1024X768_PAIGE_OPEN: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; component behavior is structurally covered
SOLO_900X1000_PAIGE_CLOSED: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; shell geometry is unchanged
SOLO_900X1000_PAIGE_OPEN: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated rendered drive; component behavior is structurally covered
UNVERIFIED: authenticated production behavior, rendered viewport evidence, and page-reload draft survival; reload survival is intentionally out of scope because storage is session memory only

OWNER_INTENT: The 2026-09-21 Option 1 final-capped ruling requires one shared pure ComposerScopeState resolver for AppShell PaigeChat and PaigeAIChat so unsent words belong only to the tenant, effective user, displayed conversation, focused client, and focused Business Mission where they were entered.
MUST_NOT_HAPPEN: No lost input; no cross-tenant, cross-user, cross-thread, cross-client, or cross-mission draft; no write while identity/history/transcript is unresolved; no duplicate send; no newer edit cleared or auto-sent by Retry; no late dictation delivery into a new scope; no visual redesign; no Supabase, MessageAudioButton, or deferred Draft-with-Paige change.
MUST_PRESERVE: Existing composer layouts, keyboard entry, dictation teardown and delivery fence, attachments, history rail, client focus, stream protocol, provider path, approval actions, thread persistence, transcript scroll, and current account-switch teardown.
ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA: Draft A is disabled but remains visible while B hydrates, then B's own draft appears; returning to A restores A; client, mission, and explicit no-focus scopes each own their draft; explicit New owns a stable slot; first thread persistence migrates that slot under the same complete focus; successful terminal send clears only the submitted unchanged draft; failure or newer edits preserve it; tenant/user/focus/sign-out changes expose no prior draft; late dictation is dropped.
MOTION_PURPOSE: NONE: no motion change.
PROTECTED_SEAMS: AFFECTED and tested — AppShell PaigeChat composer, Solo/AppShell PaigeAIChat composer, View-as-Client displayed-tenant read, history hydration, controlled selection, session-memory draft store, dictation delivery, send/retry completion, and request abort/delivery fences. NOT AFFECTED — MessageAudioButton and INT-104 voice ownership; Draft with Paige deferred P2; ConversationsRichComposer implementation; authenticated send authority; Edge functions and _shared; provider/model/tool execution; migrations; durable storage.

## Scope and collisions

- Classification: existing-flow reliability and isolation repair.
- Affected flows: type or dictate an unsent prompt; initial history resolution; explicit New; automatic newest-thread resume; controlled thread selection; client/Business-Mission/clear-focus transition; load failure; lazy thread persistence; send; truncated stream; Retry; tenant, user, and sign-out transition.
- Neighboring regressions: attachments, slash/quick actions, approval cards, history transcript loading, client focus, dictation finalization, late callbacks, scroll behavior, and failed-response recovery.
- Active-owner/file collisions: Voice agent PR #1310 owns MessageAudioButton and was merged into current main before this record; INT-102 makes no edit to that file. No active PR owns either composer file at the post-sync collision check.
- Explicit exclusions: every file under supabase/; MessageAudioButton; Draft with Paige during dictation; durable/local/session storage; page-reload recovery; visual redesign; provider/model/tool behavior.
- ConversationsRichComposer: unchanged. It is a controlled component whose parent owns one body value and clears it on selected-thread change; it does not restore one draft per conversation today. That separate behavior is not folded into this two-mount redesign.

## User job and state map

Draft key: tenantId + effective userId + conversationId + normalized focusedClientId + normalized focusedBusinessMissionId. Each absent focus is the explicit value `none`. The new-chat conversation id is a stable slot scoped to the mount context; the first persisted thread atomically moves that value to the real id under the same complete focus handle. Values live only in a module-memory store for the browser session.

| State | Entry | Visible value | Writable | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity-unresolved | tenant, effective user, portal brand, or sign-in identity absent | none from the prior identity | no | complete matching identity |
| history-unresolved | authenticated mount before history is confirmed | stable new-chat draft | no | confirmed empty, explicit New, or thread request |
| hydrating | requested thread differs from displayed thread, or identity is switching | prior displayed-thread draft only when identity still matches | no | requested transcript loads or load fails back to prior display |
| ready-new | complete identity and confirmed/explicit new-chat slot | that new-chat draft | yes unless busy | send, lazy persistence, thread request, or scope transition |
| ready-thread | complete identity and requested thread equals displayed thread | that thread's draft | yes unless busy | send/retry, thread request, or scope transition |

Send and Retry require terminal [DONE]. Each request captures tenant + effective user + conversation + focused client + focused Business Mission, the deterministic serialization of that same handle, and an AbortController. A scope transition aborts the request; every later stream, transcript, busy, retry, draft-clear, and error delivery is dropped unless the complete captured handle still matches. A successful completion clears only when the retained draft equals the submitted text under the same trim rule. Failure preserves it. A newer edit survives every outcome and is never auto-sent. Dictation captures the same complete scope handle and every final, interim, and error delivery is dropped when that handle no longer equals the writable displayed scope.

View-as-Client resolves the displayed tenant from the existing RLS-protected `clients` row selected by the impersonation contact id and effective user id. The authenticated staff tenant can never substitute for that displayed tenant: a mismatch keeps input, dictation, and Send disabled. This is read-side resolution only; the authenticated send contract and request body are unchanged from the base.

## Evidence index

- Fresh base at branch creation: 2d9350a116137a759e0d033ef181366a0ab483f3; current main 1c8718967ed36ee72ef8f00d5ee5b9d3d4ac433a merged conflict-free at c66598d7a25d52e72b9fbe82a9a66a4bb76136b6; focus-contract test-first head: 2f4b5a7dde8ac47e5d35f97e4c03b27c1d3b8e97; final capped-round code head: c481d5bd9942bdfad4484948fab9ad9776eeec88.
- Round-one test-first head 88c71cd69f46aeb9d5d1f7a6c4344d46df6d2a09: the shared-fence, effective-user tenant, AppShell abort, and PaigeAIChat thread-switch expectations produced 3 failed files / 5 failed tests, with 27 passing.
- Final-round failing-first head ae94b4426deffeaae2a264ff465e5aa4be72bafb: the real non-Solo rail-switch drive failed with 1 failed / 5 passed because the origin request was not aborted and its busy state kept the target composer locked.
- Focus-contract failing-first head 2f4b5a7dde8ac47e5d35f97e4c03b27c1d3b8e97: the pre-repair implementation produced ten named focus-contract failures, including writable client/mission transitions, colliding draft slots, and accepted late dictation delivery.
- Completed focused suite: 11 files / 127 tests passed across the transition table, both composer integrations, Solo workspace contract, dictation component/contract, AppShell remount/scroll, PaigeAIChat honesty, document proposal, and client scope.
- Load-bearing mutation: removing `composerDraftHandlesMatch` from `createComposerRequestFence.isCurrent` made the full-handle delivery contract fail (1 failed / 20 passed); restoring it passed 21/21.
- Final-round mutation: forcing `createComposerRequestFence.invalidate()` to report no released busy owner made the non-Solo rail-switch test fail because the target textarea remained disabled; restoring request-owned release made that test and the complete 117-test suite pass.
- Focus-handle mutation: normalizing every focused client and mission to `none` made 4 / 44 focused tests fail with cross-focus draft leakage in both mounts, saved-thread focus-release leakage, and focused lazy-migration leakage; restoring focus normalization passed 44 / 44.
- Static checks: focused ESLint passed with 0 errors and one pre-existing hooks warning; npm run ci:tsc passed at baseline 12/current 12; npm run ci:regression passed; npm run build passed with only repository warnings; git diff --check passed.
- Storage inspection: the resolver module uses a process-memory Map; no localStorage, sessionStorage, database, Edge function, migration, or network persistence was added.

## Review and limitations

- Fresh exact-head Codex review, CI comparison, thread dispositions, merge identity, and Vercel production deployment are pending. The Live-Path gate keeps this PR Draft, so no Ready-triggered review, merge, or deployment occurs in this return.
- Authenticated production restoration, account/thread switching, keyboard drive, and responsive rendered evidence remain explicitly unverified.
- A browser reload intentionally clears these in-memory drafts. Persisted drafts require a separate owner decision.
