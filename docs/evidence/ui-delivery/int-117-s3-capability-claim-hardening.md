# UI delivery evidence — INT-117 S3: capability-claim hardening (named third-party products)

UI_DELIVERY_EVIDENCE_VERSION: 1
FLOW_BY_FLOW: WAIVED: owner-decision=PR 1280 owner ruling 2026-09-20 (INT-083); reason=the Flow-by-Flow skill is not installed in this delivery environment. Grounding kept for the record: the touched surface is one directive string inside renderCapabilityStatusBlock — the per-turn, workspace-resolved system text that governs every "what can you do" answer in PAIGE Chat and Live Conversation (both channels assemble it via paige-ai-chat/index.ts:4601-4665); the change was traced against the render module's existing tests, the capability resolver/group contract, and the observed defect class (a claimed GHL integration — the registry contains zero GHL entries).
PAIGE_UI_DESIGN: PASS: the paige-ui-design skill was read this workstream (INT-117 memo, 2026-09-21); no visual design, interface source, copy on screen, geometry, motion, focus, action, state, or exit changed — the approved canonical Chat/Live presentation is untouched; module routing recorded: intent-fidelity applies (the owner spec's capability-truthfulness guardrail (c)); visual-immersive and interaction-geometry NOT needed (no rendered change); protected-behavior-regression applies at the prompt-contract level (the render tests); release-acceptance-evidence is this record.
MATERIAL_FLOW_CHANGE: NO: prompt-contract text only — users gain no new goal, choice, step, state, transition, confirmation, exit, or side effect; the block's position, grouping, and every existing directive are unchanged except one added sentence.
FLOW_PROTOTYPE: NOT_REQUIRED: presentation-only adjustment inside an existing system message; no action, state, exit, or consequence changes (paige-ui-design material-flow test).
PURPOSE_AUDIENCE_PRIMARY_ACTION: PASS: purpose — Paige never claims a connection to a named outside product the workspace does not have; audience — every PAIGE Chat / Live Conversation user; primary action — unchanged (send a message, receive a truthful answer).
VISUAL_DIRECTION: PASS: no frontend or visual asset changed.
AUTOMATED_EVIDENCE: PASS: src/__tests__/paige-capability-render.test.ts 12/12 (4 new INT-117 S3 tests, written against the rule — the suite's new pins fail without it): the named-third-party rule is present with all nine trap classes; when NO matching capability is resolved, no brand leaks into a capability row and the refusal rules are the only governing text; a genuinely connected Zapier item appears under its approval group so the rule permits exactly that acknowledgement; send-a-text/post-to-social stay doubly fenced; in-test sabotage-sensitivity (stripping the rule fails the pin). Mutation-proven load-bearing: dropping the rule (2 tests fail), weakening ONLY-if-in-groups (2 fail), and allowing implied connections (1 fail) each fail; restored 12/12.
STATIC_EVIDENCE: PASS: eslint clean on the test file; the render module is a pure string builder loaded through the existing transpile port (no runtime imports added); no migration, no edge bundle change beyond the shared text (edge redeploy expected via the normal pipeline because _shared/** feeds paige-ai-chat).
RENDERED_EVIDENCE: NOT_APPLICABLE: no interface source or visual state changed.
BEHAVIORAL_EVIDENCE: PASS: prompt-contract level — the assembled directive now binds named-product acknowledgement to the capability groups; this is headless contract evidence — model-behavior verification requires a live model turn and is deliberately not claimed.
AUTHENTICATED_RUNTIME: UNVERIFIED: no authenticated production chat/live turn was driven against the new directive (no provider calls authorized); day-one behavior is stated in the PR and the return to the coordinator.
KEYBOARD_FOCUS: NOT_APPLICABLE: no interactive control changed.
ZOOM_REFLOW: NOT_APPLICABLE: no layout changed.
REDUCED_MOTION: NOT_APPLICABLE: no motion changed.
STATE_COVERAGE: PASS: absent-brand state (refusal/redirect governed), connected-brand state (acknowledgement permitted only via its group), planned text/social state (doubly fenced) — each pinned by a dedicated test.
TRUTHFUL_STATE_LABELS: PASS: the directive itself is the truthfulness mechanism; no visible label changed.
SOLO_UI: NO: no recognized Solo UI path changed; the affected outcome is observed from canonical PAIGE Chat, but this PR changes only the shared render directive and its tests.
UNVERIFIED: no authenticated production conversation exercising the new rule; the deployed paige-ai-chat version carrying it (post-merge edge deploy); any claim that the rule fully eliminates brand-name hallucination — it narrows the contract, and live-model verification remains owed.

RELEASE_CHANNEL: development: exact product-code head before the evidence-only fields; production promotion only by merge automation
RELEASE_CLASSIFICATION: patch: truthfulness hardening of the capability self-description contract; no new capability
CUSTOMER_RELEASE_IDENTITY: none: internal honesty repair; no owner-approved customer release identity
RELEASE_NOTE_REQUIRED: NO: bounded truthfulness repair with no new workflow, interface action, or customer instruction
RELEASE_TRUTH_BOUNDARY: PARTIAL: the prompt contract and its tests are proven; authenticated model behavior on the new directive is unverified
RELEASE_RECOVERY: position=revert-the-sentence; reference=git revert of the merge commit plus the render tests which pin both the presence and the binding strength of the rule
