# Team Ownership & Authority Lifecycle handoff

**Status: UNAVAILABLE / future Team workstream.**

Solo Setup now records owner-provided business ownership facts and may designate an existing active
Team person as a human representative. Those facts never create a Team member, invite anyone, grant
Admin, grant workspace Owner, change an existing role, or transfer platform authority.

An owner who needs to grant or transfer actual workspace authority must be routed to this future
Team-owned lifecycle. That workstream must define, at minimum:

- Current-owner authentication and reauthentication requirements
- Recipient eligibility and active membership requirements
- Acceptance, cancellation, expiry, retry, and recovery states
- Single-owner versus multi-owner rules
- Server-enforced role transition and rollback behavior
- Notification and attributable outcome contracts
- Billing, legal, and provider dependencies without letting any one of them silently imply access
- Tenant-switch and stale-request protection
- Owner-visible audit/Rail treatment through the established shared contracts

Setup must not implement any of those transitions. Business ownership percentages are optional
owner-provided facts, are not legal validation, and never imply that stored interests total 100%.
