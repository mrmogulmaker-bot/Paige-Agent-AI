# Systems Check — Truthful Operating-Readiness Console

**Status:** SPEC — owner-directed 2026-09-04. Signal grounding in flight; production wiring gated on
owner approval of the interactive prototype (§69 Gate 1).
**Workstream:** AI orchestration / Command Center. **Tier:** Solo + sub-account (NOT operator/God).
**Supersedes:** the radial "Evidence moving through the business" treatment on
`src/solo/SoloSystemsCheckWorkspace.tsx`.

## 0. Why this document exists

The owner's brief is long, precise, and load-bearing. A brief that lives only in a chat transcript
evaporates on the next context reset — which is the exact failure §BRAIN and §0 exist to end. This
file is the durable home for it. Where a requirement below is the owner's own words, it is quoted.

## 1. The problem being fixed

> "The current page is visually polished, but it is not yet a useful operating surface for a
> business owner." — owner, 2026-09-04

The shipped surface renders a radial diagram of four nodes around a PAIGE hub, a "10 persisted
findings" count, a 6-confirmed / 3-needs-attention / 1-unavailable tally, and a single
`Last result <timestamp>`. None of it answers the questions the surface exists to answer.

### The five questions Systems Check MUST answer

1. What is genuinely working right now?
2. What is blocked, disconnected, misconfigured, or unavailable?
3. What data is current, stale, missing, or awaiting proof?
4. What can PAIGE and the connected agent team actually do today?
5. What is the most important next action, who owns it, and where does the owner go to complete it?

### Named defects in the shipped surface

| Shipped | Why it fails |
| --- | --- |
| "Data Product", "Payments Ops" | "too internal and unclear for a Solo owner" |
| "10 persisted findings" | "does not tell the owner what matters" |
| "The picture is incomplete" | "honest but too generic; the page should identify exactly which sources are incomplete and what that prevents" |
| "Last result 9/4/2026, 5:00:05 AM" | "should identify the source and freshness, not imply the entire business was checked at one timestamp" |
| "Open PAIGE for the fuller rundown" as the only exit | a generic exit is not a next action |

### The radial is reassigned, not deleted

> "Do not preserve the radial visual merely because it already exists. Reassign that design
> language to Trust Compass, where it can later represent real agent authority, grounding,
> readiness, impact, and accountability."

## 2. The four sub-tabs, and what each one answers

| Sub-tab | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| Business Game Plan *(default landing)* | what should we do? |
| Systems Check | is the operating environment ready? |
| Mind | what does PAIGE know? |
| Trust Compass | can this agent be trusted to act, within this scope, right now? |

All four derive from the shared layers — Spine, Rail, Mind. None of them holds its own data store.
Mind itself is not yet live; bringing it live is tracked separately.

## 3. Required structure

### 3.1 What needs attention now
A short prioritized list of **real** blockers, failed checks, missing setup, expired or stale
evidence, or owner decisions. Every item carries four things, without exception:

- an **owner** — the business owner, a named agent, or an external provider;
- a **source** — the actual record backing the claim;
- a **freshness date** — what was verified, and when;
- a **direct next action** — deep-linked into the real owning surface (Setup, Integrations, Sales,
  Campaigns, Clients, Billing, Command Center). *Not* a generic "open PAIGE for more".

> **A wrong link here does not 404 — it silently lies.** `/solo/*` is a splat with no catch-all. An
> unknown branch slug resolves to `branchBySlug(...) ?? "home"` and renders **Command Center** while the
> wrong URL stays in the address bar; an unknown third or fourth segment falls back to the branch's
> default. So a mistyped destination *looks like it worked*. Every link this surface emits is built
> through `subtabPath("solo", account, branch, subtab)` or `setupSubtabPath(account, tab)`, never a
> hand-written string.
>
> Four destinations a check would want **do not exist**, and an item that needs one says so rather than
> pointing at something that merely resolves: there is **no forms home** (`forms` is an alias of
> Campaigns → Catalog, and form authoring has no URL at all — the Studio opens on a window event);
> **no social-account connect action** (the route resolves to a declared-unavailable panel); **no
> working `automations` branch** (declared with three sub-tabs, all unreachable — use
> `settings/integrations/automations`); and **no roles destination under Security** (`security-data` has
> no controls; permissions live in `settings/team`). Sending identity, carrier registration and calendar
> connection are `?segment=` **queries**, not paths — written as a path they land on Communications.

### 3.2 What is ready to operate
Only capabilities with source-backed evidence. Stated plainly, in the owner's own register:

- "Email sending is ready."
- "n8n connection is available but a tenant-safe orchestration round trip is still awaiting proof."
- "Zapier API connection is not yet verified."
- "A2P registration is pending provider integration."

> "Do not claim aggregate health where the underlying picture is incomplete."

### 3.3 Operating areas
Plain business language — **not** abstract department labels. Each area carries: current status ·
what we know · source and last verified time · what PAIGE can do now · what is blocked · owner or
responsible agent · exact next action.

The initial nine areas:

1. Business setup and identity
2. People and CRM
3. Sales and commercial operations
4. Email, phone, and SMS readiness
5. Campaigns, social, and advertising
6. Integrations and automations
7. PAIGE agent team and delegated work
8. Business knowledge and data readiness
9. Security, permissions, and governance

### 3.4 Recent real verification
Only actual source-backed checks, provider outcomes, or attributable completed actions — with
success, failure, retry and freshness where those records exist.

> "Do not use fixtures, stale persisted counts, or fabricated 'confirmed' states."

This section reads the Rail. It is the direct consumer of the agent-attribution uplift: without
per-agent attribution the Rail can only say "PAIGE", which cannot answer "who owns it".

### 3.5 Owner decisions and next actions
Make obvious what the owner must do, what PAIGE can complete autonomously, and what is awaiting an
external provider or platform response.

## 4. Status vocabulary — CLOSED SET

Nothing outside this list may render, ever:

`LIVE` · `PARTIAL` · `NOT CONNECTED` · `NEEDS ATTENTION` · `PENDING PROVIDER` · `UNAVAILABLE` ·
`PROOF OWED` · `PAUSED`

> "Do not use an unexplained health percentage or trust score."

No percentage. No score. No aggregate roll-up over an incomplete picture.

### 4.1 The store cannot express two of the eight words

`paige_systems_check_finding.status` is CHECK-constrained to `pass | fail | skip | error`
(`_shared/systems-check-runner.ts:48`, and `:319` rewrites anything else to `error`). So **no signal
sourced from a persisted finding can ever render `PENDING PROVIDER` or `PAUSED`.** Those two words
have to be derived from the live source that actually holds the state — `tenant_email_domains.status`,
`tenant_a2p_registrations.*`, `paige_automations.state`, `tenant_tool_autonomy.mode` — or the runner's
four-value vocabulary has to widen.

This is a real architectural constraint on the port and it is invisible from the §8 tables. Whoever
wires a `PENDING PROVIDER` or `PAUSED` signal is reading a different table from the one every other
signal reads, and the surface must not pretend otherwise.

### 4.2 The genuine hole: switched off by someone who is not the owner — OWNER RULING NEEDED

`suspended` is a live CHECK value on six tables and is written by real shipped code: Twilio maps its
own subaccount status straight through (`provision-tenant-twilio/index.ts:73-76`); a platform operator
can freeze a tenant (`paige-mcp/index.ts:3897-3900`); an agency admin can suspend a seat
(`AgencyTeamPanel.tsx:175-180`); a carrier can suspend a registration.

**None of the eight words fits.**

- `PAUSED` is actively wrong — it tells the owner *you* switched this off, when Twilio or the platform did.
- `NOT CONNECTED` is wrong — it *was* connected, and it was taken away.
- `UNAVAILABLE` means, by this document's own gloss, that there is no source at all. Here there is a
  source and it is saying something definite and severe.
- `NEEDS ATTENTION` is the least wrong, and it fails §3.1's "direct next action" requirement whenever
  the answer is *there is nothing you can do inside Paige*.

**Honest scope.** Zero rows sit in any `suspended` state on production today, so this is
reachable-but-unoccupied — a hole, not a defect anyone can see right now. It becomes visible the first
time a carrier suspends a workspace's messaging account.

**The decision is the owner's**: either a ninth word, or a ruling that `NEEDS ATTENTION` absorbs it
with the owner-facing sentence carrying the *who switched it off* fact. The prototype renders it the
second way and annotates the compromise, so the cost is visible rather than argued.

### 4.3 A live `PROOF OWED` that is firing right now

The platform's own §68 clamp is in the capped state as this is written: `ceiling 3`,
`attested_at 2026-08-24`, and rung 3 requires both `operator_cross_tenant_canary` and
`operator_rls_coverage` to pass. The canary passed at 2026-09-04 23:00:03; `operator_rls_coverage`
**failed** in the same run. So `requested = 3`, `effective = 2`, `capped_by = 'proof'`.

That is an unfabricated `PROOF OWED`. It is also **platform state, and a Solo workspace must never
learn it** (§9) — the tenant surface may say only that something is further limited by platform
policy, without disclosing the platform's posture, ceiling, attestation or the reason.

### 4.4a A NINTH WORD IS ALREADY RENDERING — `NOT CHECKED`, disclosed rather than quietly kept

**Shipped code renders a word this section says may never render.** `SoloSystemsCheckWorkspace.tsx:692`
falls back to **`Not checked`** for any operating area whose `coveredBy` list is empty — today that is
*Paige's team and delegated work*, *Business knowledge — the Mind*, and *Security, permissions and
governance*, all three visible on the live Solo surface.

That is a direct contradiction of this section's own "nothing outside this list may render, ever", and
it is recorded here rather than left for someone to discover, because a spec that disagrees with the
code it governs is worse than no spec (§13 · §66).

**Why none of the eight was used.** The closed set has no term for *no check exists for this area at
all*, which is a different fact from every word it does carry:

- `UNAVAILABLE` is the near miss and is still wrong. By §4.2's own gloss it means a source was
  consulted and could not answer. Here nothing was consulted, because nothing is wired to consult.
- `NOT CONNECTED` asserts a connection that is absent. These areas are not connections.
- `PROOF OWED` implies a proof is pending. Nothing is pending; no check has been written.
- `NEEDS ATTENTION` is a claim that something is wrong. Nothing is known to be wrong, and saying so
  would be the exact fabrication §13 forbids — an absent check is never evidence of a fault.

**The distinction is load-bearing, not pedantic.** "We looked and could not tell" and "we have never
looked" are different promises to the owner, and only one of them implies a defect somewhere. Collapsing
them would make the surface less truthful, which is why the ninth word was used.

**The decision is the owner's**, in the same shape as §4.2: either ratify `NOT CHECKED` as a ninth
member of the closed set, or rule that one of the eight absorbs it and accept the implication that word
carries. Until then the surface renders the truthful word and this section records that it is outside
the ruled set.

### 4.4 Two data defects found while grounding the vocabulary

**`automation_wired` is filed under `domain = 'payments_ops'`** (`20260816000000_systems_check_layer1.sql:270`,
live-verified). An automation check therefore renders under the **Payments Ops** node. The L2 §38
correction fixed its sibling's `runner_key` and never touched the domain. This is a mis-file, not a
naming preference.

**Eight of the ten tenant check names are engineering vocabulary**, and "configured" appears in four of
them: `Comms configured across the board` · `Website connected or detected` · `External automation
solution wired` · `Company info populated` · `Customers present in CRM` · `Sales pipeline scoped and
configured` · `Sales revenue tracking configured` · `Payment method options configured`. The four
node labels an owner sees are the raw `domain` enum title-cased by `label()`
(`SoloSystemsCheckWorkspace.tsx:27-28`) — which is why "Data Product" and "Payments Ops" read internal.
Both are registry-content fixes, not surface fixes.

## 5. The Refresh contract

Refresh must be real. It either:

- performs the supported current checks and displays updated source and freshness evidence; **or**
- says plainly that a source cannot currently be checked.

> "It must never refresh a static fixture and represent it as live operating evidence."

A signal that cannot be re-checked on demand says so, and says why. Every re-runnable check must
name its callable seam, and the seam must be invocable by a Solo owner/admin/coach under RLS.

### 5.1 What the seam actually supports — grounded, not assumed

**A genuine on-demand re-check exists today and needs no backend change.** Invoking
`systems-check-run-onboarding` from the browser with the workspace's own session runs the full
ten-check catalog and returns a real summary. `verify_jwt` is false at the gateway, but the function
falls through to `resolveTenantFromJwt`, which verifies the JWT and derives the tenant **server-side**;
a browser holds neither the service-role key nor the cron token, so it can never reach the trusted
branch, and `body.tenant_id` is honoured only for a platform owner. A workspace cannot re-check
another workspace.

**Today's `refresh()` is not that.** It calls `qc.invalidateQueries` and re-reads the same persisted
run (`useSystemsCheck.ts:151-153`). That is a legitimate action with a legitimate label — *"Re-read
the last recorded run. Nothing was re-checked."* — and it is the exact thing that must never be
labelled a re-check. **The two are different buttons and always will be.**

**Three costs of the real re-check, which the surface says out loud rather than hiding:**

1. `paige_systems_check_run.scan_flavor` is CHECK-constrained to
   `('onboarding','scheduled','change_triggered')`, so a human-requested run is recorded as an
   *onboarding* scan. The audit trail will not say a person asked for it until a migration widens it.
2. Both browser-reachable flavors use `actionFiling: "all"`, and `file_action` has no dedupe. Pressing
   twice against eight failures files sixteen remediation actions and burns sixteen model calls.
3. It is one blocking POST — every check and every drafted fix completes before the response returns.
   There is no progress stream.

### 5.2 An honest in-flight state is available, and our own comment denies it

The run row is inserted **before** the first check runs (`systems-check-runner.ts:277-291`) and
`completed_at` is patched at the end (`:469-477`). So a run in progress is readable right now as the
latest run with `completed_at IS NULL`, and the snapshot RPC already returns that column. The surface
can say *"A check is running now — started 08:41"* from real state rather than from a timer.

`useSystemsCheck.ts:64` asserts the opposite — *"the scan writes its run only on completion"*. That
comment is false, and it is why the honest in-flight state looks impossible. Correcting it is part of
the wiring work.

### 5.3 The structural fix that unblocks the rest

`systems_check_snapshot` returns **only the latest run's** findings
(`20260822000000_systems_check_snapshot_rpc.sql:52-61` and `:113`). Three consequences compound:

- **A partial scan erases the whole picture.** `rescanBusinessContext.ts` fires three
  `change`-triggered scans in parallel after a Setup save; each writes a run row with
  `check_count` of one or two, and whichever finishes last becomes *the* latest run. After any Setup
  save, this surface's entire reading collapses to a one-check scan. That is live behaviour today.
- **Remediation filed against an older run is invisible.** Paige has eight actions filed for the pilot
  workspace, three of them against checks that are still failing, and none of them can be reached from
  this surface.
- **Per-check re-run can never be made safe** while a single-check run replaces the view.

The fix is one function replacement and no table change: `DISTINCT ON (f.check_id) … ORDER BY
f.check_id, f.created_at DESC` in place of `WHERE f.run_id = v_run_id` — latest-per-check rather than
latest-run. It is a semantics change and needs its own §37 consumer walk, because `run.check_count`,
`pass_count` and `fail_count` would no longer describe the finding set on screen.

**Sequence: this first, then the on-demand scan flavor and caller-supplied `actionFiling` together,
then per-check re-run.**

### 5.4 The exact labels

| What the button does | Label | Result line |
|---|---|---|
| Re-reads the persisted run | **Refresh current data** | *"Re-read the last recorded run. Nothing was re-checked."* |
| Runs the full catalog and awaits the summary | **Re-run the checks** | From the returned summary only: *"Re-ran 10 checks — 3 passed, 6 need attention, 1 could not be evaluated."* |
| A run is in flight | — | *"A check is running now — started 08:41."* Everything shown is labelled last-recorded. |
| The run failed | — | *"The re-check did not run: {error}. The result below is still the last recorded run from {time}."* |

A count that no run produced never appears. A check that did not execute is `UNAVAILABLE` — not
passed, not failed, and never quietly omitted.

## 6. Scope boundaries

**In scope.** Grounding every signal; the truthful status contract; the Refresh contract; the
prototype; wiring only the proven signals; labelling every unproven source `UNAVAILABLE` or
`PROOF OWED`.

**Out of scope — explicitly.** A2P/Twilio provider functionality and Zapier API/MCP
implementation. Those are separate active workstreams.

> "Instead, create reusable truthful result contracts so those separate workstreams can feed
> Systems Check when their real state is available."

So this workstream defines the **result contract** those workstreams must satisfy, and consumes it
when they publish. It does not implement them.

**Design jurisdiction (§00).** The owner set this direction himself and it is ported as given.
Visual treatment beyond that direction is Claude Design's. Claude Code owns whether each value is
wired to a real backend or an honest absence, whether the next action actually resolves, and
whether the surface renders at all.

**Viewport.** Keep the Command Center form-fitting at the required Solo viewports.

> "Do not make the page a dense monitoring dashboard or introduce broad scrolling as an escape hatch."

## 7. Required sequence

1. Ground every proposed signal in a real source, owner, freshness rule and safe status vocabulary.
2. Produce the interactive prototype across **empty, partial, ready, blocked, provider-pending,
   failure, retry, and workspace-switch** states.
3. Keep the radial/dial concept for the separate Trust Compass sub-tab.
4. Wire only proven signals into the production page.
5. Label every remaining source unavailable or proof owed rather than creating decorative status.

Step 2 is the §69 Gate 1 approval point. No production UI ships before it.

## 8. Grounded signal inventory

*Produced by an eleven-agent grounding pass against live production (ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`), 2026-09-04. Every row names the source that backs it. A signal with no source is not in this table — it is in that area's **unavailable** list below it, with the searches that prove the absence.*

**101 grounded signals across nine areas. 57 things an owner would expect that have no source today.**

| Status today | Signals |
|---|---|
| `LIVE` | 28 |
| `NOT_CONNECTED` | 26 |
| `PENDING PROVIDER` | 1 |
| `PARTIAL` | 27 |
| `PROOF_OWED` | 9 |
| `NEEDS_ATTENTION` | 7 |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | 3 |

> **Read the status column before the signal.** `LIVE` means a real source answers it now. `PARTIAL` means the source exists but does not cover the whole claim. `PROOF_OWED` means something asserts it and nothing has verified it. `UNAVAILABLE` means there is no source at all. Only `LIVE` may render without a qualifier.

> **And read it as a snapshot, not as the signal's nature.** Each status below is the value **one
> workspace held on 2026-09-04**, not the set of states that signal can occupy. That distinction
> caused a real error: the sending-domain row was recorded `NOT_CONNECTED` because no tenant was

Two facts I could verify mechanically: `git diff --name-only edge-live..HEAD -- supabase/functions/**` is EMPTY, so every edge function cited (growth-process-submission, growth-inbound, content-draft, the systems-check runners, tenant-campaigns, meta-schedule-post) is live on prod exactly as written here; `git diff --stat db-live..HEAD -- supabase/migrations/**` returns…
