# Integration Capability Registry — the provider-governance & delivery-record contract

**Read this before you propose, implement, open a PR for, or change ANY provider integration** — a
third-party API, connector, OAuth scope, Marketplace service, MCP tool over a provider, or
external-execution worker. **Before merge, update the relevant entry** with the actual capability,
authority, proof, limitations, and next owner (the delivery rule, below).

Grounded 2026-09-06 against `origin/main` `c69a13362f8dd412d1f4fbcd4f82c91a033c844f`.

## What this is

The **single, machine-readable + human-readable catalogue and taxonomy** of every third-party
provider, API, connector, Marketplace service, and external-execution platform Paige may use, and how
each is **governed** — its authority lane, its Rail/Mind/Memory boundary, its M1 metering dependency,
its canonical provider receipt, and its honest delivery status.

The authoritative machine-readable form is **`integration-capability-registry.json`** (this
directory). This README is its human-readable companion. **The JSON is the source of truth for full
per-provider detail;** CI (`lint:integration-registry`) validates the JSON only — the summary table
below is a hand-maintained companion that must be updated alongside the JSON (§BRAIN.3).

**This is a product-governance and delivery record — NOT a provider-integration build.** It does not
install providers, request credentials, call external APIs, create OAuth clients, or ship provider
functionality. It records what the platform has decided about each provider and what is true today.

## The cardinal rule

> **Listing a provider here NEVER means it is connected, available, or autonomous.** A registry entry
> is a governance declaration, not a live capability. Connection is a per-tenant authorization fact;
> availability is a `getTierFeatureSet()`/RLS fact; autonomy is a `resolve_tool_autonomy()`/Trust
> Compass fact. This document decides none of them (rules R1, R6, R8).

## What this is NOT — and the names it must not be confused with (§18)

- **Not a fork of existing docs.** It is the *provider-axis unifying index*. Each entry cites its
  grounding source. It cites — never restates:
  - `docs/brain/config-registry.md` — the env-var-NAMES/IDs **wiring** inventory (this doc is the
    capability/authority/governance axis on top).
  - `docs/product/provider-result-contract.md` — the **runtime per-tenant connection-state** seam a
    provider workstream publishes into Systems Check (its eight-word vocabulary — `NOT CONNECTED /
    PENDING PROVIDER / LIVE / PROOF OWED / NEEDS ATTENTION / PAUSED / UNAVAILABLE` + the `suspended`
    hole — is a **different** vocabulary from this registry's six delivery states, and the two are
    deliberately kept apart).
  - `docs/binding-ledger/surface-binding-ledger.json` — how each **surface** binds to Paige (this doc
    is the **provider** axis).
  - `docs/architecture/MARKETPLACE-DATA-MODEL.md` — the `marketplace_items` (global metadata) /
    `marketplace_installs` (only per-tenant state) data model rule R4 rests on.
  - `outputs/paige-at-cowork/09-paige-capability-system.md` — the owner-locked capability matrix by
    capability **area** (this doc is the same governance by **provider**).
- **Not the Spine "capability registry."** `supabase/functions/_shared/paige-spine/registry.ts` is a
  runtime object (Spine domain declarations). Unrelated.
- **Not the code-level "Integration Registry, slice 1."** Migration `20261005000000` is the
  provider-scoped `tenant_mcp_connections` table (n8n + Zapier) holding **per-tenant connection
  state**. That is runtime state; this doc is the governance record above it.
- **Not authorization, and not a design record.** An entry is an observation about the contract, never
  permission to build, and holds zero opinion about how any surface looks (§00).

## The six delivery states (the task-mandated vocabulary)

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LIVE` | delivered and proven usable for its declared authority lane — the integration's DELIVERY state, never a claim any tenant connected it or that Paige may act autonomously |
| `PARTIAL` | some of it is real; the exact remaining gap is named |
| `PROPOSED` | an approved/drafted DIRECTION exists; nothing is built |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | the contract/substrate does not exist, or the provider is not wired at all |
| `DEFERRED` | deliberately sequenced for a later slice |
| `PROOF_OWED` | implemented and reachable in code, but authenticated end-to-end runtime proof (§32.c) is absent — never report as LIVE |

## The five authority lanes (§16 / §67, shared with the binding ledger)

`read` · `draft` · `auto` · `confirm` · `prohibited`. An entry declares the highest lane it currently
supports. **Role/authority is separate from tier** (R6): tier eligibility says who an integration is
*for*; the authority lane + `resolve_tool_autonomy` + RLS say who may *act*. **Admin is a role, never
a URL and never a tier** (§53/§65).

## Tier eligibility (Platform · Solo · future Agency · future Enterprise)

A **governance declaration** of who each integration is for. Actual runtime availability is enforced
by `src/lib/tier/tierFeatures.ts` (§60) and RLS — never by this document (§65, the name is not the
authority). `solo` covers Standalone Solo and Sub-account (same base feature set, §60). Distribution
follows tier-matrix §61 default unless an owner exception is recorded. Values: `eligible` /
`ineligible` / `resell` / `deferred` / `na`.

## The taxonomy (stable — extended only by owner ruling)

1. **Productivity / documents** — Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, doc tools. (Native Paige artifacts
   are NOT here — R5.)
2. **Finance / accounting / payments** — Stripe, QuickBooks, Plaid, and opt-in finance-vertical
   providers (§2/§194, §38 bind).
3. **CRM / calendar / communications** — external CRM, calendar, telephony, email, messaging.
4. **Marketing / ads / social / public presence / analytics** — ad platforms, social publishing,
   analytics/observability.
5. **Files / contracts / Vault** — e-signature, contracts, file intake, Vault OCR/DLP seam.
6. **Marketplace / MCP / automation specialists** — the Platform Marketplace, the MCP door, n8n,
   Zapier, browser/sandbox execution, sub-agent specialists.

## The nine governing rules (full text in the JSON `rules`)

- **R1** Listed ≠ connected/available/autonomous.
- **R2** Honest status only — design/prototype never exceeds `PROPOSED`; code without runtime proof is
  `PROOF_OWED`, never `LIVE`.
- **R3** No secrets — names, IDs, scopes, behaviour only.
- **R4** Platform Marketplace entries are **global capability metadata only** — never tenant
  credentials, usage, private client material, purchases, or billing (`marketplace_installs`, the only
  per-tenant state, is out of scope).
- **R5** Private Paige artifacts require no external provider; **native** Google Workspace / Microsoft
  365 creation requires **that tenant's** explicit connected-provider authorization.
- **R6** Role/authority is separate from tier; Admin is a role, never a URL or tier.
- **R7** Workers (n8n / Zapier / MCP / provider APIs / browser) run **under** Paige's authority, never
  a bypass (door-blindness).
- **R8** Every consequential external effect owes a canonical provider receipt, a Rail outcome, and
  (for metered/spend effects) an M1 metering dependency.
- **R9** §2 finance is never a platform default; credit is monitoring-only, never repair (§194).

## The delivery rule (MANDATORY — §0 / §66 / §BRAIN.3)

> **Before** proposing, implementing, opening a PR for, or changing any provider integration, the
> agent **reads the relevant registry entry** (or records that none exists yet). **Before merge**, the
> same PR **creates or updates that entry** — actual capability, authority lane, proof (or
> `PROOF_OWED`), limitations, next owner — **in the same commit**. Shipping the integration change
> without the registry update is §13/§66 drift.

Enforced by: this README + the JSON, `docs/brain/README.md` (index + read-first table),
`docs/PAIGE-MASTER-PROJECT-REFERENCE.md` §3/§4, `.claude/skills/second-brain/SKILL.md` (read table),
and the structural guard `scripts/ci/integration-registry-lint.mjs`
(`npm run lint:integration-registry`).

## The structural guard (CI-safe, concise — clones `lint:binding-ledger`)

`scripts/ci/integration-registry-lint.mjs` fails CI when the JSON is structurally incomplete or
dishonest: a missing top-level section; a provider missing a required field; an unknown status /
authority lane / taxonomy id / tier value; a duplicate id; a `LIVE` entry without a real canonical
provider receipt (that would be an unproven claim); a `marketplace_metadata_only` entry that carries a
per-tenant credential/usage/purchase/billing field (rule R4); or a taxonomy group with no catalogued
provider. It is regex/JSON-only and dependency-free, with a `--self-test`. It is a **tripwire** for the
honesty invariants, not a semantic parser — whether a lane mapping is correct stays a human §5/§39
responsibility.

## Honest platform position (grounding SHA)

- **No provider is autonomous, and few are `LIVE`.** The two `LIVE` entries are the **Platform
  Marketplace** surface (install mechanics shipped) and the **inbound MCP door** (the governed decision
  is live — and it *refuses* every mutation). LIVE there is a delivery fact, not a Paige-autonomy fact.
- The communications/scheduling/social/automation providers (Twilio, Google Calendar, Resend, Meta,
  n8n, Zapier) are `PARTIAL` with named gaps; accounting/e-sign (QuickBooks, DocuSign) are
  `PROOF_OWED`; Microsoft 365 is `DEFERRED`; HubSpot / Vapi / Browserbase are `UNAVAILABLE`; the Vault
  OCR/DLP seam is `PROPOSED`.
- **Coverage is honest, not complete.** The catalogued providers span all six taxonomy groups and all
  six status words. Every other WIRED provider (per master §4) is named in
  `uncatalogued_wired_providers` so nothing is hidden; the delivery rule requires the next PR touching
  one to promote it to a full entry. Pure delivery infrastructure (Supabase, Vercel, the LLM router,
  Voyage, GitHub) is listed in `excluded_delivery_infrastructure` and governed by `config-registry.md`,
  not here (§18).

## Grounding note — "Marketplace Brain decision" (§13 honesty)

The task brief named a *"Marketplace Brain decision"* as a grounding input. A repo-wide search finds
**no artifact recorded under that phrase**. The registry's Marketplace rule (R4) is instead grounded
in `docs/architecture/MARKETPLACE-DATA-MODEL.md` (the metadata-only data model) and the master-ref
Marketplace facts. If a "Marketplace Brain" ruling exists by another name, it should be linked here in
the next update — recorded as unresolved rather than invented (§BRAIN.2).

## How to keep it true (§BRAIN.3 / §66)

Any PR that adds, changes, or removes a provider integration — or changes a provider's
scope/authority/receipt/Rail-Mind-Memory posture, or lands an owner ruling about one — **updates the
relevant `integration-capability-registry.json` entry in the same commit**, updates this README's
summary table, and re-runs `npm run lint:integration-registry`. Record the honest state — never imply a
provider is connected/available/autonomous because it is listed (R1).
