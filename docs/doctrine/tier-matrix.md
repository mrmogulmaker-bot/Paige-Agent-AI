## Purpose

Every callable seam in the platform is reached by callers wearing one of **six identity
tiers**. A change that is "correct" for a standalone tenant can silently break, over-expose,
or under-serve a client, a sub-account, or an anonymous visitor — because each tier resolves
its `tenant_id`, carries its auth token, sits under RLS, and is granted RPC scope by a
*different* code path. This doc enumerates all six against the **live prod resolver bodies**
(ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`, read via `pg_get_functiondef`, 2026-08-02) so no tier is ever
assumed instead of grounded.

The six tiers are **canonical and closed** — extended only by an explicit owner ruling. No
build invents a seventh tier or collapses two.

## The canonical six

| # | Tier | One-line identity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **God / Super Admin** | Platform operator (us). Owns and sees everything; no single home tenant. |
| 2 | **Agency** | Parent tenant that owns sub-accounts. Scoped to its own book **plus** its children. |
| 3 | **Standalone Tenant** | Coach/consultant/agency-of-one with no agency parent. Own book only. |
| 4 | **Sub-account** | Child tenant under an Agency. Own book only; isolated from the parent aggregate. |
| 5 | **Client** | End-consumer under a Tenant. Their own portal only. |
| 6 | **Anonymous** | Unauthenticated public. Public surfaces only; no `auth.uid()`. |

**Live population (grounded 2026-08-02):** `SELECT account_type, count(*), count(parent_tenant_id)
FROM tenants GROUP BY account_type` returns **1 agency** (0 with a parent) and **7 standalone**
(4 of which carry a `parent_tenant_id`). So today: 1 Agency, 3 true Standalone Tenants
(standalone + no parent), and 4 Sub-accounts (standalone + parent set). Sub-account is a
**relationship** (`parent_tenant_id IS NOT NULL`), not a distinct `account_type` value — a
grounding fact that trips anyone who assumes an `account_type = 'sub_account'` exists. It does
not.

## The resolver substrate (read from live bodies)

Every tier's four columns below trace back to these SECURITY DEFINER resolvers. Quoting the
real resolution order matters because the two tenant resolvers **disagree**, and that
disagreement is itself a tier hazard.

### `is_platform_owner()` / `is_platform_owner(uuid)` — the God gate
Both are thin delegates:
```
is_platform_owner()        → SELECT public.is_super_admin()
is_platform_owner(_user_id) → SELECT public.is_super_admin(_user_id)
```
and `is_super_admin()` is:
```
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles
               WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'super_admin'::public.app_role)
```
**God is identified by a row in `user_roles` with `role = 'super_admin'` — not a flag on
`tenants`, not `owner_user_id`, not `features`.** A broader sibling, `is_platform_admin()`,
matches `role IN ('platform_admin','super_admin')`; it is the gate that appears inside
`current_user_tenant_id()` (see below), so a `platform_admin` who is not a full `super_admin`
still gets the operator escape hatch there.

### `current_user_tenant_id()` — the primary tenant resolver (Tiers 2/3/4)
```
SELECT COALESCE(
  (SELECT p.active_tenant_id FROM profiles p
     WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() AND p.active_tenant_id IS NOT NULL
       AND ( EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM tenant_members m
                       WHERE m.user_id = auth.uid() AND m.tenant_id = p.active_tenant_id
                         AND m.status = 'active')
             OR agency_can_manage_child(p.active_tenant_id, auth.uid())
             OR agency_team_role(p.active_tenant_id, auth.uid()) IS NOT NULL
             OR is_platform_admin(auth.uid()) )),
  (SELECT tenant_id FROM tenant_members
     WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
     ORDER BY joined_at ASC LIMIT 1)
);
```
Real resolution order:
1. **`profiles.active_tenant_id`** (keyed on `profiles.user_id = auth.uid()`) — but only if
   the caller is *entitled* to that active tenant by one of four guards: active membership,
   `agency_can_manage_child`, non-null `agency_team_role`, or `is_platform_admin`. This guard
   is what lets an **Agency** user (Tier 2) or a **God** user (Tier 1) legitimately set their
   active tenant to a child/any tenant and have it resolve.
2. **Fallback:** first active `tenant_members` row **`ORDER BY joined_at ASC LIMIT 1`**. This
   fallback **is deterministic on `joined_at`** (ties/NULL `joined_at` aside). Do **not**
   describe this fallback as an unordered `LIMIT 1` — it is ordered. (The unordered hazard
   lives in the *other* resolver; see #589 below.)

### `get_paige_persona_context()` — the Client-first resolver (Tier 5)
```
_tid := (SELECT c.tenant_id FROM clients c
           WHERE c.linked_user_id = auth.uid()
           ORDER BY c.created_at ASC LIMIT 1);
IF _tid IS NULL THEN _tid := (SELECT p.active_tenant_id FROM profiles p WHERE p.id = auth.uid()); END IF;
IF _tid IS NULL THEN _tid := (SELECT m.tenant_id FROM tenant_members m WHERE m.user_id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1); END IF;
IF _tid IS NULL THEN _tid := (SELECT t.id FROM tenants t WHERE t.owner_user_id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1); END IF;
```
Real resolution order: **`clients.linked_user_id` → `profiles.active_tenant_id` →
`tenant_members` → `tenants.owner_user_id`**, then it returns the tenant row with
`funding_enabled` (computed from `features`) and `brand` (via `resolve_tenant_brand`, which
walks `parent_tenant_id` up to depth 10 so a sub-account inherits an agency's brand).

**Two honest hazards in this body — both worth a ledger entry:**
- **`profiles.id = auth.uid()` (not `profiles.user_id`).** The persona resolver keys the
  profile branch on `profiles.id`, while `current_user_tenant_id()` keys on
  `profiles.user_id`. These are **distinct columns** (both `uuid`, both live). For any user
  whose `profiles.id` ≠ `auth.uid()`, the persona resolver's profile branch silently misses
  and falls through. Flag on any change that touches profile→tenant resolution.
- **Steps 3 and 4 are unordered `LIMIT 1`** (no `ORDER BY`). For a user in **multiple**
  tenants who is neither a client nor has an `active_tenant_id`, the resolved tenant is
  **nondeterministic** — this is the ambiguity logged as **#589**. It bites multi-membership
  users; single-membership users resolve deterministically by accident.

### `is_tenant_member(uuid)` / `is_tenant_admin(uuid)` / `is_tenant_admin_as(uuid,uuid)`
```
is_tenant_member(_tenant)   → EXISTS tenant_members WHERE tenant_id=_tenant AND user_id=auth.uid() AND status='active'
is_tenant_admin(_tenant)    → EXISTS tenant_members WHERE tenant_id=_tenant AND user_id=auth.uid() AND status='active' AND role IN ('owner','admin')
is_tenant_admin_as(_actor,_tenant) → same as is_tenant_admin but for an explicit _actor (no auth.uid())
```
These are the per-tenant membership/role gates RLS policies compose. `_as` variants take an
explicit actor so a service-role or delegated call can assert membership on behalf of a named
user rather than `auth.uid()`.

### `agency_can_manage_child(uuid[,uuid])` / `agency_team_role(uuid,uuid)` — the Agency reach
`agency_can_manage_child(_child,_actor)` is true when the child's parent is
`account_type IN ('agency','enterprise')` **and** the actor is either the parent's `owner` via
`tenant_members`, or an `agency_team_members` row with `agency_role IN
('agency_owner','agency_admin','agency_manager')`, or an `agency_specialist` whose
`scoped_subaccounts` array contains the child. `agency_team_role(_agency,_actor)` returns
`'agency_owner'` for the parent owner else the `agency_team_members.agency_role`. **Note:**
`'enterprise'` is an honored `account_type` in these bodies even though **no `enterprise` rows
exist live today** — the code is ahead of the data.

## Per-tier matrix

Each tier states its **(a) tenant_id resolution path**, **(b) auth-token flow**, **(c) RLS
posture**, and **(d) permitted-RPC scoping**, each grounded in a named resolver above.

### Tier 1 — God / Super Admin
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** No home tenant. `current_user_tenant_id()` still returns a
  value *if* they set `profiles.active_tenant_id` — the guard's `OR is_platform_admin(auth.uid())`
  branch lets a platform admin's active tenant be **any** tenant and resolve. This is the
  operator "act-as" seam: God impersonates a tenant by setting active tenant, and every
  tenant-scoped resolver then treats them as that tenant.
- **(b) auth-token flow.** Standard Supabase JWT (`auth.uid()` present). Elevation is **not**
  in the token — it is the `user_roles.role = 'super_admin'` row read by `is_super_admin()`.
  Service-role callers (Paige's headless operator agent) bypass RLS entirely and must self-scope.
- **(c) RLS posture.** Policies that call `is_platform_owner()` / `is_platform_admin()` grant
  read/write across **all** tenants. Everything else is reachable via the act-as active tenant.
  Broadest posture on the platform; the §17 governance laws (immutable audit, two-key on
  destructive ops, never-silent break-glass) bind here, not RLS.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** All operator RPCs (fleet, provisioning, platform billing,
  default registries) plus, via act-as, any tenant RPC. A God-tier producer in a §37 inventory
  must be listed even when "it's just us" — the operator path is the most powerful caller.

### Tier 2 — Agency
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** `current_user_tenant_id()` primary branch: their
  `profiles.active_tenant_id`, entitled via `agency_can_manage_child(active, uid)` **or**
  `agency_team_role(active, uid) IS NOT NULL`. This lets an agency user's active tenant be
  **their own** agency tenant *or* any **child** they manage, and it resolves. Fallback is
  their agency membership row (`ORDER BY joined_at ASC`).
- **(b) auth-token flow.** Standard JWT. Agency reach is not in the token — it is the
  `agency_team_members` / parent-owner `tenant_members` rows read by the two agency helpers.
- **(c) RLS posture.** Scoped to **own book + owned sub-accounts**. Policies that compose
  `agency_can_manage_child` expose child-tenant rows to the agency; policies that only check
  `is_tenant_member(child)` do **not** (an agency owner is not automatically a `tenant_members`
  row of the child). Cross-check *which* helper a policy uses before assuming agency reach.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** Own-tenant RPCs plus child-scoped RPCs gated by the agency
  helpers. An `agency_specialist` is further narrowed to `scoped_subaccounts` — a real
  sub-tier of Agency reach the inventory must not flatten.

### Tier 3 — Standalone Tenant
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** `current_user_tenant_id()`: `profiles.active_tenant_id`
  entitled by **active `tenant_members`** membership; else the `ORDER BY joined_at ASC LIMIT 1`
  fallback. `parent_tenant_id IS NULL` and no agency relationship — the plain-vanilla path.
- **(b) auth-token flow.** Standard JWT; `auth.uid()` maps to a `tenant_members` row of their
  own tenant.
- **(c) RLS posture.** Own book only. `is_tenant_member(own)` true; `is_tenant_admin(own)` true
  for owner/admin. No child reach, no parent. This is the reference posture most policies are
  written against — which is exactly why the other five tiers must be checked *separately*.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** All tenant-scoped RPCs for their own `tenant_id`; no operator
  RPCs; no cross-tenant reach.

### Tier 4 — Sub-account
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** Resolves like a Standalone Tenant for the sub-account's **own**
  members: `current_user_tenant_id()` → their `active_tenant_id`/membership on the child. The
  child is identified by `parent_tenant_id IS NOT NULL` (live: `account_type = 'standalone'`
  with a parent). Its **own** members do not gain the parent's reach.
- **(b) auth-token flow.** Standard JWT of a member of the child tenant. Brand/persona inherit
  upward via `resolve_tenant_brand`'s recursive parent walk, but **authority does not** —
  inheritance is one-directional (brand down, not permissions up).
- **(c) RLS posture.** **Own book only, isolated from the parent aggregate.** The critical
  invariant: a sub-account's own users must never see sibling sub-accounts or the agency
  roll-up. Conversely the agency *does* reach in (Tier 2). Any change touching child data must
  be checked from **both** directions — sub-account-in (must stay isolated) and agency-down
  (must still reach). This is the tier most often missed because it shares `account_type` with
  Tier 3.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** Own-`tenant_id` RPCs only. Aggregate/roll-up RPCs must
  exclude the sub-account's own users and include the managing agency's — a two-sided check.

### Tier 5 — Client
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** **Not** `current_user_tenant_id()` — a pure client has no
  `tenant_members` row and (usually) no entitled `active_tenant_id`, so that resolver returns
  **NULL** for them. Clients resolve through **`get_paige_persona_context()`**, whose first
  branch is `clients.linked_user_id = auth.uid() → clients.tenant_id` (earliest by
  `created_at`). Their portal scope is the tenant that owns their `clients` row.
- **(b) auth-token flow.** Standard JWT; `auth.uid()` maps to `clients.linked_user_id`, not to
  a membership row. A client surface that calls `current_user_tenant_id()` instead of the
  persona resolver will get NULL and mis-scope — a common tier bug.
- **(c) RLS posture.** **Own portal only.** Policies gate client-owned rows on the
  `clients`/`linked_user_id` join, never on `is_tenant_member`. A client is not a tenant member
  and must never pass a membership gate.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** Client-portal RPCs only (their own intake, their own
  documents, their own conversation). No tenant-admin RPCs, no cross-client reach within the
  same tenant.

### Tier 6 — Anonymous
- **(a) tenant_id resolution.** None. `auth.uid()` is NULL, so **every** resolver above returns
  NULL/false. There is no tenant to resolve.
- **(b) auth-token flow.** No JWT (or the anon key only). Reaches only what the `anon` role is
  granted.
- **(c) RLS posture.** Only rows exposed by an explicit `anon`/`public` policy, or data behind
  a SECURITY DEFINER RPC that deliberately serves the public (a public landing config, a public
  form-submit endpoint). Everything gated on a resolver is closed.
- **(d) permitted-RPC scoping.** Public RPCs only — and each such RPC is a §37 producer of the
  **Anonymous** tier that must be inventoried, because "public" is the easiest place to leak
  tenant data. An anonymous producer is never "N/A by default"; it is audited like any other.

## Known ambiguities and hazards (log, don't hide — §13)

| Ref | Hazard | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **#589** | Unordered `LIMIT 1` (no `ORDER BY`) makes tenant resolution **nondeterministic** for multi-tenant users with no client row and no `active_tenant_id`. | `get_paige_persona_context()` steps 3 (`tenant_members`) and 4 (`tenants.owner_user_id`). |
| profile-key drift | `get_paige_persona_context()` keys the profile branch on **`profiles.id = auth.uid()`** while `current_user_tenant_id()` keys on **`profiles.user_id = auth.uid()`** — distinct columns; the persona branch silently misses when they differ. | Two resolvers disagree. |
| `enterprise` phantom | `agency_can_manage_child` honors `account_type IN ('agency','enterprise')` but **no `enterprise` rows exist live**. Code ahead of data; don't assume the enum is exhausted by live values. | `agency_can_manage_child`. |
| sub-account ≠ account_type | Sub-account is `parent_tenant_id IS NOT NULL`, not a distinct `account_type`. Filtering by `account_type = 'sub_account'` matches nothing. | `tenants` shape. |
