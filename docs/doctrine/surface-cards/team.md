# Surface card — Team (Solo)

**Truth label: `PARTIAL`.** The capability runs correctly and is governed correctly; the owner
cannot see what Paige did. See *Rail outcome* below — that is the whole reason this is not `LIVE`.

Written 2026-09-02 by applying the Alignment Standard's build path to the Team capability. Legs 1–5
pass. Legs 6–7 do not.

**The code this describes is already LIVE ON PRODUCTION**, merged in #728 (`76bb3bbca`) — the
tools, their risk classifications, the tenant-agreement guard, the autonomy clamp and the catalogue
migration. Verified 2026-09-02 against prod (`xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`), not inferred from the merge:
`schema_migrations` carries `20261039000000` and `20261040000000`, and `list_tool_autonomy()`
returns all five `team_*` rows under the `Team` category. This card is the department's record of a
shipped capability, not a proposal.

**That is why `PARTIAL` matters rather than being a paperwork nicety.** The capability is running
for tenants now, so the gap below — an owner cannot see what PAIGE did to their team — is running
too.

**Team is NOT declared in the Spine registry.** `supabase/functions/_shared/paige-spine/registry.ts`
declares exactly one capability today (`PIPELINE_DEAL_STAGE_EVIDENCE`). Team should be declared —
and the reason it cannot be declared *complete* is the same reason this card is `PARTIAL`: the
registry requires `outcome.railVisibility`, and Team has none.

## Owner decisions of record — 2026-09-02

Recorded exactly as ruled. **Decision 2 describes work that has not happened**; decisions 1 and 3
describe the platform as it already behaves. Nothing here is implemented by being written down.

### 1. The six access-changing Team actions stay in PAIGE, classified `high`

Invite · resend invitation · revoke invitation · change permission/access · grant role · revoke
role. Each requires the **canonical, server-verified owner approval card before execution**. PAIGE
may propose the action and explain it, and may carry it out only after the owner explicitly
approves that exact bounded action. She may never manufacture approval, raise autonomy, or bypass
the domain authorization check.

**This matches the live code.** All six are `high` in `_shared/action-risk.ts`; the gate accepts
only a fingerprint of the exact rendered card, carried in the request **body**, which the model
cannot write.

| Tool | Classification |
|---|---|
| `team_invite_member` | `high` |
| `team_invite_resend` | `high` |
| `team_invite_revoke` | `high` |
| `team_set_permission` | `high` |
| `member_grant_role` | `high` |
| `member_revoke_role` | `high` |
| `team_set_work_profile` | `ordinary` |

**A correction is recorded here rather than smoothed over.** The first version of this ruling said
every Team mutation was `owner_only`, and this card recorded it as a gap against the code. That
wording was wrong for the product, and the owner corrected it. The distinction is the reason it
mattered: **`owner_only` is not a stronger gate — it removes an action from Chat entirely, at any
approval strength.** Applying it here would not have hardened the Team tools, it would have
withdrawn PAIGE's ability to help an owner run their team, which is the opposite of the intent.
`high` is the setting that means *she can do it, and only after you approve this exact call*.

**`team_set_work_profile` stays `ordinary`**, because it changes only job title and
responsibilities and cannot alter access. It still requires the normal compact confirmation and
ordinary domain authorization. **It must never be represented as a permission change** — the RPC
writes two text columns and cannot reach `permission`, and any copy suggesting otherwise is false.

### 2. A Team event is not a client event

**Do not emit a client Rail event with a null `contact_id`.** The future repair is a *distinct
tenant/workspace-level outcome projection* carrying: safe actor · action · target member or
invitation · approval binding · result · owner-visible evidence. It must be proposed as its own
**Spine Change Request** and implemented in its own coordinated workstream. Not started here.

### 3. `PARTIAL` is not lifted by documentation

Team stays `PARTIAL` until **both**: the owner can see a truthful, tenant-scoped outcome after PAIGE
acts, **and** the live authenticated flow is proven. Writing a card does not move a truth label.

### Related, and separately active: PR #728's post-merge follow-up

#728 is the merge that put this capability on production. Its post-merge review raised **four P1
findings and one P2**, and they are **an active hotfix in their own workstream — not repaired, and
not made irrelevant by anything in this card.** Two of them land on surfaces this card describes:

- **P1 · `src/hooks/useRailEvents.ts`** — when the tenant or contact changes mid-flight, an
  in-flight history query can merge the *previous scope's* events into the new feed. The Rail
  reading described below is therefore not simply "working"; it has an open cross-account staleness
  defect against it.
- **P1 · `src/solo/data/useSoloPendingActions.ts`** — pending action titles, summaries and drafts
  from the previous tenant persist on the Trust Compass after an account switch.
- P1 × 2 · `supabase/functions/paige-apply-extraction` — a partial sync counted as success, and an
  extraction claim not released when the transport rejects.
- P2 · `src/components/dashboard/PaigeAIChat.tsx` — a failed Skip leaves a proposal unretryable.

Nothing in this card should be read as evidence about those findings either way.

## Owner job and user flow

An owner or admin decides who is on their workspace and what each person may do: invite someone,
resend or withdraw an invitation, describe what a teammate owns, and change what a teammate can
access. Two entry points, one seam — the Team screen, and PAIGE in the rail beside it.

## Tenant data / domain owner

| | |
|---|---|
| Membership | `tenant_members` (role, `is_owner`, status, `job_title`, `responsibilities`) |
| Invitations | `tenant_invite_tokens` where `kind = 'team'` |
| Identity | `profiles` (display name), `auth.users` (email, last sign-in) |
| Read | `get_solo_team_workspace(_search,_permission,_limit,_offset)` · `get_paige_team_context()` |
| Write | `set_solo_team_member_work_profile` · `set_solo_team_member_permission` · `create_/resend_/revoke_solo_team_invite(_actor, _expected_tenant_id, …)` (service-role only, behind the `solo-team-invitations` edge function; authority proved by `solo_team_invite_authority`) |

All are `SECURITY DEFINER` with the authority check **in the body**, so the same refusal applies
whether the request came from the screen or from a sentence.

## Solo shell placement

`/solo/{account}/settings/team` — Settings group, `SoloTeamWorkspace`. PAIGE reaches the same seam
from the expanding rail (`openPaige` → `expandRail`), beside whatever screen is open.

## States

| State | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Empty (first use) | One member, the owner. "Your workspace starts with you" + invite the first teammate |
| Create | Invite dialog: address, access level, optional title/responsibilities, then a review step naming all four before anything sends |
| Edit | Member editor — work details and permission are separate controls with separate confirmations |
| Save | Reads back the **stored** values, not the submitted ones |
| Cancel | Modal dismiss restores focus to the invoking control |
| Retry | Invitation resend/revoke per row; roster retry on a failed load |
| Denied | "You don't have access to this team" — distinguished from a load failure |

## What PAIGE can read

`get_paige_team_context()` → a sanitised block: roster with `user_id`, name, email, **enforced**
permission, job title, responsibilities; invitations with `invitation_id`, address, proposed
permission and lifecycle status. Control characters stripped, fields length-capped, **the invite
token never included**. Marked `REFERENCE DATA ONLY`; tenant-authored work text explicitly confers
no authority. Suppressed entirely when the block's tenant ≠ the conversation's tenant.

## What PAIGE can propose or perform

| Tool | Seam | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `team_set_work_profile` | `set_solo_team_member_work_profile` | `ordinary` |
| `team_set_permission` | `set_solo_team_member_permission` | `high` |
| `team_invite_member` | `solo-team-invitations` create | `high` |
| `team_invite_resend` | resend | `high` |
| `team_invite_revoke` | revoke | `high` |

Ids come from the context block only — never a name PAIGE resolved herself. Nobody can be made an
owner; the permission enum is `admin | member` and the database refuses `owner` besides.

## Required confirmation / approval

The four `high` tools require the rendered card's fingerprint, carried in the request **body** — a
channel the model cannot write. `confirm: true` from the model is refused for them. Cards name the
person and the consequence, not the enum, and a `high` card whose subject cannot be named is
refused rather than shown unnamed. A workspace `auto` setting does **not** lower this: as of
2026-09-02 the handler clamps `auto` → `confirm` for any `high` or `owner_only` action.

**This paragraph describes the platform as it runs today, and it is also the ruled end state**
(owner decision 1 above): the six access-changing Team tools stay in Chat at `high`, each behind
the canonical server-verified approval card, and `team_set_work_profile` stays `ordinary`.

`team_set_work_profile` is `ordinary` — reversible, in-tenant, and structurally unable to reach
`permission`.

## Rail outcome and follow-up — **THE GAP**

**A Team action emits no Rail event, and the owner has nowhere to see that it happened.**

- `emitRailForTool` returns early on `if (!contactId) return` — the Rail is per-client by
  construction. Team actions have no contact. Emitting one anyway would invent a client
  involvement, so the early return is *correct*; the Rail simply cannot carry a workspace-level
  outcome.
- An attribution row **is** written to `paige_audit_log`: tenant-stamped, naming the tool, the
  target table and id, the outcome, and which authority allowed it. It is durable and correct.
- **No Solo surface reads `paige_audit_log`.** The two owner-facing activity feeds — the Trust
  Compass panel and the Team hub's own *"What the team did"* — both read `paige_client_events`
  through `useSoloActivityFeed`. So **a permission change PAIGE makes on this very team does not
  appear in that team's own activity feed.**
  **AMENDED 2026-09-02 — the conclusion stands, and the reason is stronger than this bullet says.**
  Those feeds do not merely lack a Team event: **they cannot read the Rail at all.**
  `useSoloActivityFeed` selects `paige_client_events` directly as `authenticated`, and production has
  **no SELECT grant for that role on that table** (revoked by `20260712200000`, never re-granted;
  read-only catalog query, 2026-09-02). The read therefore fails before RLS.
  **Status of record: `UNAVAILABLE` — production Rail history cannot be read, and the current
  owner-facing consumer treatment is not reliable enough to distinguish denied history from empty
  history** (issue **#746**). ~~*The hook honestly renders an error rather than an empty feed.*~~
  **CORRECTED same day (§58):** the two shipped Context Rail consumers
  (`PaigeRailFeed.tsx:108`, `ClientActivityFeed.tsx:144`) read only `{ events, connected }`, and
  `historyError`/`historyLoaded` have no reader in `src/` — so a refused read renders as "nothing yet."
  The Solo Trust Compass consumer (`compass.tsx:377`) does distinguish, which is why the status is
  *not reliable enough* rather than *never*. So the destination this bullet points at is unavailable
  for **every** department, not only for Team's contact-less events, and it can present as absence
  rather than as failure. See `docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md`. Nothing here is repaired by
  the amendment; Team stays `PARTIAL`.
- Because PAIGE is a rail *beside* the page, an owner sitting on Team with PAIGE open sees a stale
  roster after she acts: `useTeamWorkspace` refetches on mount and on its own mutations, and
  nothing signals it from the chat.

**This is a Spine Change Request, not self-service work — and the Spine foundation says so in its
own words.** `docs/architecture/paige-spine-foundation.md` opens by stating the foundation *"does
not create a second Rail, event bus, memory store, approval store, or PAIGE workspace"*, and the
registry requires either `NONE` or an approved Change Request identifier for a shared primitive. A
workspace-level (non-client) rail event is exactly such a primitive. The Chat workstream inventing a
second activity substrate to close its own visibility gap is the duplication the one-approval-gate
rule exists to prevent, in a different costume.

**The owner has since answered the half of this that was open (decision 2 above).** A Rail event may
NOT carry a null `contact_id` — a Team event is not a client event. The repair is a distinct
tenant/workspace-level outcome projection carrying safe actor, action, target member or invitation,
approval binding, result and owner-visible evidence. It is a separate Spine Change Request in its
own coordinated workstream, and it has not been started.

Note also that the feed named above is itself under an open P1 (`useRailEvents` cross-account
staleness, from #728's follow-up), so "the owner sees it in the Rail" is not yet a safe destination
even for the events that do carry a contact.

## Dependencies, collisions, and required browser proof

- **Depends on:** the action-risk policy, the confirmation/approval gate, `current_user_tenant_id()`,
  `get_paige_persona_context()`, the `solo-team-invitations` edge function, `send-portal-invite`.
- **Known collision, unresolved:** `crm_list_team` (`list_team_members`) and the Solo Team functions
  read the same `tenant_members` table but disagree on authorization source (global `user_roles` vs
  tenant membership), owner labelling, suspended members, and truncation. Two homes for "who is on
  the team".
- **Repaired (`20261045000000`, #815):** the three invitation RPCs used to resolve their workspace
  from `profiles.active_tenant_id` **raw**, while everything else COALESCEd through
  `current_user_tenant_id()`, so a sole owner with a null pointer was told they were not an owner —
  on the Team screen and, before PAIGE's workaround, in her voice. Invitation authority is now
  proved by `solo_team_invite_authority(_actor, _expected_tenant_id)` against a workspace the caller
  NAMES: the Team screen sends the `tenant_id` it rendered the roster from, PAIGE sends the tenant
  the conversation is about, and the resolver proves active owner/admin membership in that exact
  workspace. It is refusal-only — a named workspace can abort a call and can never select one.
  Nothing in the invitation path reads the raw pointer any more, so a stale pointer is structurally
  incapable of steering an invitation. PAIGE's `inviteSeamBlocked` workaround was DELETED rather
  than moved: leaving it would have relocated the same false refusal into TypeScript, where the
  database could no longer falsify it.
  - The `current_user_tenant_id()` fallback was deliberately **not** inherited. Its second arm picks
    the earliest active membership, which is fine for a roster read that self-corrects on screen and
    wrong for an invitation, which emails a live 7-day access token to a stranger. Owner ruling,
    2026-09-02: a guess is acceptable only where a harmless read can self-correct.
  - Still true and NOT repaired by this change: the null-pointer population itself. Provisioning
    never writes the column, the client computes a working value and declines to persist it, and
    removal clears it by design. The repair makes that harmless for invitations only; other raw
    readers of `active_tenant_id` were not audited.
- **Required browser proof, OWED ON A LIVE CAPABILITY — no leg of this has been driven on the live
  authenticated platform, and the code is already serving production.** The order of those two
  facts is the point: this is not proof owed before a release, it is proof owed on something
  already released. Needed: invite a real address from chat and from the screen; resend and revoke;
  change a permission and confirm the roster reflects it; edit work details and confirm the
  omitted field survived; drive the owner-only refusal as an admin; and confirm what the owner sees
  afterwards, which is the gap above.
