# Surface Binding Ledger — the Paige OS Integration release/regression contract

**Read this before claiming any surface is "Paige-connected," and before designing, sequencing, or
building any Spine / Rail / Mind / Memory / Chat / surface binding.**

Grounded 2026-09-06 against `origin/main` `0b48f26df84e84c781c427f46e06023a6371f366`.

## What this is

The **single, machine-readable + human-readable ledger** of how every meaningful Solo surface binds
to Paige, across one governed chain:

```
canonical source → server-resolved tenant scope → safe Paige-readable context → authority
  → governed write/action → verified outcome → Rail evidence → Mind eligibility → Memory retention
```

The authoritative machine-readable form is **`surface-binding-ledger.json`** (this directory). This
README is its human-readable companion: the vocabulary, the release rule, the honest platform
position, and a compact per-surface summary. **The JSON is the source of truth for full per-field
detail** (safe facts, prohibited fields, per-link status, linked PRs/issues, next slice, grounding
sources). **CI (`lint:binding-ledger`) validates the JSON only** — it enforces the JSON's structural
completeness and honesty invariants; it does not parse this README, so the summary table below is a
hand-maintained companion that must be updated alongside the JSON (§BRAIN.3).

## What this is NOT

- **Not a fork of existing docs.** It is the *unifying index*. Each row cites its grounding source:
  `docs/architecture/paige-mind-integration-matrix.md` (the Mind axis + safe/forbidden facts),
  `docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md` (Spine/Rail state), the Spine registry
  (`supabase/functions/_shared/paige-spine/`), `docs/doctrine/canonical-solo-parity-matrix.md`
  (routing/parity), and the per-department `docs/doctrine/surface-cards/`. When those change, the
  ledger row is updated in the same commit (§BRAIN.3) — it never restates them from memory.
- **Not authorization.** A row is an observation about the contract, never permission to build.
  Implementation is assigned by the owner.
- **Not a design record.** Per §00, this ledger records what *works* / is *wired*; it holds zero
  opinion about how any surface looks. The retired orbital PaigeMark → current Command Mark is a
  design decision owned by Claude Design and is deliberately absent here.

## The six states (never let a UI, a badge, a prototype, or an "Open Paige" button masquerade as a binding)

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LIVE` | the full intended binding is real **and proven by authenticated end-to-end runtime** |
| `PARTIAL` | some binding links are real; the exact remaining gaps are named |
| `READ_ONLY_CONTEXT` | Paige can safely understand this surface but cannot act on it |
| `INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED` | sensitive data on this surface must not enter Paige/Mind/Memory |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | the required Paige-binding contract does not exist yet |
| `PROOF_OWED` | the binding is implemented and reachable in code, but authenticated/runtime proof is absent |

## Two dimensions per surface — proven-today vs the operating target (owner ruling, 2026-09-06)

Every surface carries **two independent answers**, and the second must never be shrunk by the first:

1. **`state` — what is PROVEN today.** The six-state vocabulary above. Strictly truthful about current
   proof; the CI guard forbids overclaiming it.
2. **`intended_capability` — the product operating TARGET.** Paige is built to help *run the company
   through real governed actions*, not to report passively. So each surface also declares, across the
   five **authority lanes** (mapped to §16 🟢 auto / 🟡 confirm / 🔴 off and §67 per-process grants):

   | Lane | What it declares |
   |---|---|
   | `read` | what Paige may safely read and understand (enumerated safe facts; never raw payload/secrets) |
   | `draft` | what she may draft, model, organize, prepare, or recommend — a proposal with **no side effect** |
   | `auto` | what she may **execute autonomously** within a tenant-approved policy (🟢) |
   | `confirm` | what requires **owner confirmation** before execution (🟡, via `paige_pending_confirmations`) |
   | `prohibited` | what is **permanently isolated/prohibited** — raw secrets, credentials, unreviewed files, authority escalation (🔴) |
   | `completion_criterion` | the **real action/outcome** that proves the surface is done — never merely "open" or "summarize" it |

   **An absent current proof (`state`) never erases the intended target (`intended_capability`).** The
   ledger describes the *gap* between present proof and the full operating goal — it does not narrow the
   goal to what happens to be built today.

## The release/regression contract (CI-enforced)

> A surface may not be reported `LIVE` / "Paige-connected" without a **complete** ledger entry whose
> state is `LIVE` **and** whose `evidence_class` includes `authenticated_runtime`.

`scripts/ci/binding-ledger-lint.mjs` (`npm run lint:binding-ledger`) fails CI when:
- a surface claims `LIVE` without `authenticated_runtime` evidence, or with a `none` canonical source / safe context;
- a surface claims `PROOF_OWED` while also claiming `authenticated_runtime` (that would be `LIVE`);
- `INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED` carries no `isolation_note`;
- any entry is structurally incomplete (missing chain link, empty `sources`, unknown state/evidence class, duplicate id);
- a surface omits `intended_capability` or any of its five authority lanes + `completion_criterion` (the target must be declared, not dropped);
- a `completion_criterion` names no real action/outcome — i.e. it reads as merely "open" or "summarize" the surface.

This is the mechanical form of §13 (honest reporting) + §32 (a green build is not a working render),
applied to the binding chain. A ledger a session can quietly edit to say "LIVE" without proof is worse
than none.

## Honest platform position (grounding SHA)

**No surface is `LIVE`.** Mind axis-B — authenticated, tenant-safe evidence flowing for a real owner —
is `NO` for every surface (per the Mind integration matrix). Concretely:

- **`PROOF_OWED`** (safe read-context implemented + chat-injected + unit-tested; authenticated runtime
  proof absent): `campaigns.pipeline` · `campaigns.social` · `settings.setup` · `settings.team`.
- **`PARTIAL`** (some links real, gaps named): `command-center.business-game-plan` (the Business
  Mission governed write — create/revise/transition — is wired + chat-bound via #983; no Rail outcome,
  no auth-runtime, composite-plan Mind lens still needs #647) · `command-center.trust-compass`
  (authority governed server-side; the visible dial is a non-authoritative fixture) ·
  `settings.integrations` (n8n writes wired to the Rail capability-run write; zero rows in prod) ·
  `settings.billing` (safe status source contract shipped, not injected; secrets isolated) ·
  `paige.workspace` (handoff carries client scope but drops the intended prompt, #771, and still
  accepts raw prose).
- **`INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED`**: `settings.vault` · `settings.security-data`.
- **`UNAVAILABLE`** (contract not built, sourceless, or awaiting a Spine Change Request): the rest —
  Command Center (Systems Check / Mind tab), all Clients surfaces, Calendar, Catalog, Sales, Overview,
  Performance, Analytics, Marketplace, Connections, Vibe Studio, and the intentionally-separate
  Operator console.

`paige.workspace` is recorded `PARTIAL`, not PROOF_OWED — the workspace is the *consumer* of bindings;
its own gap is the handoff seam Phase 1 addresses.

## Per-surface summary

| Surface | State | Why / gap | Next slice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paige workspace | `PARTIAL` | sole chat surface, server-safe scope; no surface identity, prompt dropped (#771), raw `clientContext` prose | Phase 1: adopt the Surface Context Handoff Contract |
| Command Center → Business Game Plan | `PARTIAL` | Business Mission governed write (create/revise/transition) wired + chat-bound (#983); no Rail outcome / auth-runtime; composite-plan Mind lens needs #647 | Phase 4.1: authenticated drive of a mission write; Mind lens via #647 |
| Command Center → Systems Check | `UNAVAILABLE` | safe lens exists, unwired; needs SCR-2 + SCR-3 | Phase 4.4 read-only context |
| Command Center → Mind tab | `UNAVAILABLE` | a knowledge visualization, not the PAIGE Mind contract | none until #647 |
| Trust Compass | `PARTIAL` | authority governed server-side; visible dial is a non-authoritative fixture | Phase 4.3: reconcile dial to real governed action or mark read-only |
| Campaigns → Overview | `UNAVAILABLE` | no tenant-authorized campaign source | none |
| Campaigns → Catalog | `UNAVAILABLE` | real source, no Paige lens; SCR-1/2 | reference `get_pipeline_routing_evidence` shape |
| Campaigns → Sales | `UNAVAILABLE` | Rail producer dead (#787) | none until #787 decided |
| Campaigns → Pipeline | `PROOF_OWED` | the one Mind lens; authenticated drive never run + signal never produced | produce one real Rail row, then drive |
| Campaigns → Social | `PROOF_OWED` | `social.presence` read+write wired/tested; no auth drive (supersedes the pre-2026-09-05 matrix) | authenticated drive |
| Campaigns → Performance | `UNAVAILABLE` | no metrics source; the model for how Mind should decline | none; point Mind away |
| Campaigns → Vibe Studio | `UNAVAILABLE` | creative overlay, not a data binding | out of scope (§26 creative memory) |
| Clients → People | `UNAVAILABLE` | no Mind-safe lens; owner's own UI write emits no Rail (#757 "do not start") | resolve producer gap first |
| Clients → Conversations | `UNAVAILABLE` | message bodies forbidden to Mind | future transcript-evidence ingestion |
| Clients → Calendar | `UNAVAILABLE` | FU-3 Rail contract absent; attribution untruthful (#786); six-PR collision | resolve #786 + FU-3 |
| Clients → Portal | `UNAVAILABLE` | separately owned product surface | out of scope |
| Settings → Setup | `PROOF_OWED` | `business_context.readiness` deployed + injected; owner UI-flow proof owed | Phase 4.4 authenticated proof |
| Settings → Team | `PROOF_OWED` | `team.authority` wired; PAIGE can act (capability PARTIAL); auth proof owed | Phase 5 |
| Settings → Connections | `UNAVAILABLE` | safe subset unwired; credentials isolated; private finding #788 | Phase 5 |
| Settings → Integrations | `PARTIAL` | n8n readiness + 12 mgmt capabilities wired; zero capability_run rows in prod | authenticated drive → first Rail row |
| Settings → Vault | `INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED` | Phase 2 owner/admin foundation + quarantined intake shipped (#986); raw docs/credentials never cross | Phase 7: OCR/DLP-inspected promotion of reviewed facts |
| Settings → Billing | `PARTIAL` | safe status source contract shipped, not injected; secrets isolated | Phase 8 bind safe status only |
| Settings → Security & data | `INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED` | autonomy authority is non-Chat (§67/§68) | none as a write binding |
| Analytics | `UNAVAILABLE` | needs SCR-2 + SCR-3; strongest existing authorization semantics | Phase 8; reference consumer for SCR-2 |
| Marketplace | `UNAVAILABLE` | the most blocked; SCR-1/2/3 | bind safe install-state only |
| Operator / Platform | `UNAVAILABLE` (out of Solo scope) | intentionally separate tree, tenant-less | out of scope; no subaccount/operator work without release |

## How to keep it true (§BRAIN.3 / §66)

Any PR that ships a binding, changes a surface's source/scope/authority/outcome/Rail/Mind/Memory
posture, or lands an owner ruling **updates the relevant `surface-binding-ledger.json` row in the same
commit**, and re-runs `npm run lint:binding-ledger`. Record the honest state
(`LIVE`/`PARTIAL`/`READ_ONLY_CONTEXT`/`INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`PROOF_OWED`) — never
imply a capability is live because a UI or prototype exists — and the next owning workstream + the
dependency it must read first.

## Sequenced remainder (Phases 2–8 — bounded implementation slices, MVP cadence)

Phase 0 (this ledger) and Phase 1 (the handoff contract, `docs/doctrine/surface-context-handoff-contract.md`)
are published. The implementation of individual bindings continues as bounded slices, each of which
updates its ledger row on merge.

> **THE NEXT RUNTIME SLICE — Business Game Plan + Missions (owner ruling, 2026-09-06).** It must
> demonstrate an **actual governed Paige action with a verified outcome and Rail evidence** — Paige
> creating / revising / sequencing / advancing a real Business Mission on this surface — **not merely a
> richer context handoff.** The governed write (`business_mission.create/.revise/.transition`, #983) is
> already wired and chat-bound; the slice is to DRIVE it end to end (owner-confirmed), verify the state
> change, and record the outcome on the Rail so the owner sees it. That moves
> `command-center.business-game-plan` from `PARTIAL` toward `LIVE`.

- **Phase 2** — verified action outcome + Rail backbone (`governedExecution.ts` seam adoption beyond the
  MCP door; `record_capability_run` fed by real acts; owner-visible outcome reading, #746).
- **Phase 3** — Mind/Memory eligibility (the Memory seam shipped in Release C; the Spine SCRs — SCR-1
  workspace-outcome projection, SCR-2 non-client subject, SCR-3 record/list shape — remain unraised).
- **Phase 4** — Game Plan ↔ Missions; Pipeline governed action loop (#755); Trust Compass; Systems Check.
- **Phases 5–8** — Team/Connections; Campaigns subtabs; Mind/Vault; Billing/Analytics/Marketplace/Clients/Calendar/Portal.
