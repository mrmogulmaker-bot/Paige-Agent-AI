# Paige Agent AI — Master Project Reference

**The single source of truth. Read this first, every session, every day.** Cowork · Claude Code · Codex — all three agents open this doc before responding to anything substantive. It reflects the reality of the codebase (§13 honesty), not memory.

**Locked:** 2026-08-09 by Antonio Cook + Cowork · **Owner:** Antonio · **Living:** update on every merge · **Cross-refs:** every deeper doc is in Section 9.

> **Current owner override — 2026-09-06:** Admin is a role, never a URL. The legacy privileged
> route, its descendants, redirects, shell flags, and delayed authentication entry are retired.
> Requests to those old addresses use the ordinary immediate unknown-route behavior. Authentication,
> account selection, setup, OAuth callbacks, notifications, tenant workspaces, and operator capability
> remain in their explicit canonical routes and resolve authority server-side. This supersedes every
> older section that describes legacy route dependency, smart redirects, or a shared admin shell,
> including the prior note that three Solo tenants depended on unset shell flags. Durable hotfix status
> and proof live in `docs/evidence/ui-delivery/retire-admin-route.md`.

> **Current owner override — 2026-09-07:** `PlatformUpdateBanner` is the sole customer-facing update
> surface for this MVP. Canonical release records remain durable internal evidence; they do not create
> a second customer destination. Generic builds say only “An update is ready.” Approved customer
> names, versions, and concise What’s new content appear only when one valid canonical record resolves
> to the exact production build; every missing, invalid, stale, ambiguous, future, staged, unsafe,
> superseded, unapproved, or technical record fails closed. No unread badge, workspace/account indicator,
> Updates page, navigation item, modal, feed, or dashboard is authorized. Any future Updates destination
> requires a separate owner decision. Explicit reload must preserve registered forms, Paige drafts,
> attachments/file processing, streaming responses, and Studio work.

> **Current owner override — 2026-09-07:** After sign-in, Platform staff do not bypass account
> selection. `/choose-account` pauses so the authenticated person deliberately selects either
> **Platform** (the internal Platform Operator environment) or one of that person's directly
> authorized Paige workspaces. Tenant choices remain the RLS-visible tenant intersection with the
> caller's own active `tenant_members` rows and enter through the guarded `switchTenant` seam.
> Platform selection exits tenant scope through the same audited context seam before navigating to
> `/operator/fleet`. The retired `/admin` route is never a fallback, compatibility destination, or
> special case. Every established user with at least one valid membership pauses for deliberate workspace choice on each fresh login, including a one-workspace user. When the
> chooser cannot resolve a valid selection, it stays fail-closed with honest recovery; established
> non-membership signup/pricing routing is outside this repair. This supersedes the 2026-09-01 account-picker statement
> that Platform operators retained direct routing.
>
> **Note on identifiers (§11/§34):** operator-infrastructure account SIDs (Twilio Org/Account/subaccount SIDs, etc.) are **redacted** from this in-repo doc — GitHub secret-scanning blocks them and doctrine keeps them out of artifacts. The literal values live in the owner's Twilio console + the owner handoff, never in the repository.

## 0. How to use this doc (the daily protocol)

### Session-start ritual (Cowork / CC / Codex — every session)

Before responding to ANY substantive request:
1. **Read Section 4** — What's SHIPPED, including the chronological Section 4.0 Shipped Delivery Log. Never claim something isn't built without checking this first.
2. **Read Section 5** — Current focus + gaps. This is what the platform genuinely needs next.
3. **Read Section 7** — Sequential roadmap. Know what's queued so proposals fit the plan.
4. **Read Section 10** — §13 corrections log. Cowork/CC/Codex have made memory mistakes; the corrections here prevent repeats.
5. **Before any PR/merge/deploy/version/customer update, read the canonical release policy** —
   `docs/doctrine/release-governance-and-customer-update-policy.md`. <!-- RELEASE_GOVERNANCE_POLICY -->
If the request touches a specific slice, load the canonical deep doc for it from Section 9.

### Session-end ritual (any agent that ships work)

1. **Update Section 4** — append every `main` merge to the Section 4.0 Shipped Delivery Log and update capability checkboxes when something genuinely became shipped
2. **Update Section 5 status** — a gap closed, or a new one surfaced
3. **Log §13 corrections in Section 10** if the work revealed the codebase disagreed with what someone claimed
4. **Cross-post to the brain** (`docs/brain/` once PR #410 merges)
5. **Complete release governance** — exact build identity + channel always; customer version/name and
   What's New only when the coherent outcome earns them.
6. **Commit** with message: `docs(master): update after <PR#/slice>`

### Cowork paste-to-CC/Codex standard

Every paste Cowork produces for CC or Codex includes the line:
> Reference `docs/PAIGE-MASTER-PROJECT-REFERENCE.md` Sections 4 + 5 before starting; update Section 4 on merge; log any §13 corrections in Section 10.

## 1. Vision & MVP Definition

### What Paige is

Paige is the **AI COO** for a client-based service business — coaches, consultants, agencies, thought leaders, advisors. Not a chatbot. Not a CRM. An intelligent, tenant-authored, two-way client portal (§7) that orchestrates a team of specialist sub-agents (§8, §14) across a 10-department operating model (§16), and stays Paige-governable end-to-end so an operator or a tenant can drive it by voice or chat (§10, §20).

**Two audiences, one Paige Runtime Harness (§7 + §8):**
- **For the operator/tenant:** pipeline, follow-ups, retainers, content, campaigns, at-risk triage, daily brief
- **For each client:** a deliberate client-scoped projection through the tenant's branded portal: onboarding, approved progress, messages, requests, tasks, documents, approvals, next steps, and bounded Paige help

The **Tenant Client Portal is an MVP capability and competitive differentiator**. It is the governed,
client-facing experience a Paige tenant provides to that tenant's own external clients. It is not the
later **Paige Enterprise Success Portal**, which would serve Paige's direct enterprise customers.

**The moat is intuitiveness (§36):** every capability enters through a path a non-technical owner can discover in <5 minutes. If the user has to learn how to prompt, we've regressed the category.

### What MVP means

Per `docs/doctrine/canonical-build-order.md` (owner-locked 2026-08-08):

**MVP = Wave 4 ("MVP integration hub").** Wave 4 combines:
- The 4 Owner Trilogy platform pillars (Section 2)
- The 5 Cowork-locked product specs (Section 2)
- BRD-promoted MVP items: L8 Memory Fabric (was W5) · Interactive Analytics UI (was S2) · Playwright web-browsing (was W7) · Promotional account type (NEW) · Paige chat compaction + persistent history + persistent tasking (BRD §174-176)

**GA target:** ~Month 16 per `docs/strategy/monetization-rollout-2026-07-21.md` (Phase 2 of the 5-phase rollout: Closed Beta → Public Beta → GA → Scale → Category Leadership).

**"Launch-ready" gates:**
- Track S security cluster complete (per `docs/paige-master-implementation-order.md`)
- Wave 8 = BETA LAUNCH prep (#135 Codex sweep · #74 logo scrub · #194+#195 Stripe wire-up · #129 tenant lifecycle wind-down)
- Wave 9 = SOC 2 (post-BETA)

## 2. Owner Trilogy — the load-bearing pillar structure

Two pillar systems working together — the platform-side differentiators + the customer-portal ownership matrix.

### Platform-side (4 pillars, owner-locked 2026-08-04)

Canonical strategy doc: **`docs/strategy/owner-trilogy-2026-07-26.md`** (715 lines, revised 2026-08-04).

**§13 correction:** the name says "Trilogy" but the current owner-locked spine has FOUR pillars, not three. Do not shorten to three from memory.

| # | Pillar | What it does | Status | Backing research |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Systems Check** | Automated audit of tenant's operating stack (30-check catalog) | Task #80 · spec pending | `docs/strategy/systems-check-and-analytics-landscape-2026-07-26.md` |
| 2 | **Business Vault** (L1 → L2/L3/L4 partner stack) | Compliance obligations tracker with legal/tax/HR partner network | Task #81 (L1 first) · spec pending | `docs/strategy/business-vault-partner-landscape-2026-07-26.md` |
| 3 | **Twin Capabilities** | Direction A: browser-agent · Direction B: team-member twin · Direction C: business twin | Direction A in Wave 4 | `docs/strategy/twin-capabilities-landscape-2026-07-26.md` |
| 4 | **Owner Analytics + Competitive Intelligence (Newswire)** | Live comp analysis + competitive intelligence feed | Tasks #203 (Live Comp) + #100 (Newswire) + #97 (Integrity substrate) | `docs/strategy/systems-check-and-analytics-landscape-2026-07-26.md` |

**Audit-trail** (sometimes mentioned): maps to **§39 Integrity Governance**, a doctrine section (drafted in `docs/doctrine/claude-md-amendment-draft-2026-07-28.md`), NOT a fifth pillar.

### Customer Portal-side (7 pillars × 5 stakeholders, LOCKED SPEC 2026-08-08)

Canonical: **`docs/product/customer-portal-owner-trilogy-taxonomy-matrix.md`**.

**7 pillars:**
1. **Journey & Progress** — where the client is in the tenant's program
2. **Communications** — messages between client and tenant, Paige-mediated
3. **Documents & Deliverables** — signed agreements, session recaps, coach-produced work
4. **Payments & Billing** — **§38 CRITICAL:** tenant BYO-processor; Paige is never merchant of record for tenant→client transactions
5. **Sessions & Calendar** — booked sessions, kickoffs, reminders, reschedules
6. **Profile & Consent** — client's own PII, communication preferences, data-sharing consents
7. **Support & Help** — how the client reaches the tenant, Paige, or platform support

**5 stakeholders × rights matrix:** Client · Tenant/Coach · Sub-account · Agency · God/Super Admin, with **OWN · CONFIG · WRITE · READ · —** per pillar cell. See the LOCKED SPEC for the full matrix.

**MVP Harness rule:** `Tenant business → shared governed Paige Runtime Harness → client-scoped portal experience`.
Tenant-side Clients screens, portal configuration, routes, or invite primitives do not by themselves
make this end-to-end client capability live.

### Paige Runtime Harness — owner-approved internal operating architecture (2026-09-08)

**Live audio continuation (2026-09-08):** owner authorizes completing real Live Conversation using
the existing account and server-only secrets, without new purchase/upgrade/legal agreement.
Development begins with bounded owner-only account inspection, not activation from metadata.
Provider audio remains UNAVAILABLE and authenticated voice PROOF OWED. Shared scroll P0 has been
reopened by its owner; the previous acceptance is superseded pending that separate correction.
The initial freeze was withdrawn; Live work coordinates concrete overlap and composes with the repair.
Current scope and evidence remain in the existing Live delivery/evidence records, not a new ledger.

**Active Live Presence iteration (2026-09-08):** the owner approved the organic asymmetric
Live Conversation Presence and actual played-output reaction. This development candidate preserves
the one-Harness/thread, accepted #1057 scroll contract and governed execution path. Safe production
readiness still has zero provider verification records and no scope/privacy/cost approval; realtime
audio remains `PROOF OWED` and disabled. Local moving/audio-fixture evidence is not authenticated
provider proof. See [existing Live delivery packet](delivery/paige-live-conversation-mvp.md).

**Decision and present truth.** Paige owns one provider-neutral Runtime Harness that connects her
knowledge, reasoning, tools, authority, work, verification, evidence, and controlled improvement.
This architecture is approved. Its current implementation is **PARTIAL** and distributed; a
centralized, end-to-end Harness is not `LIVE` merely because several constituent systems exist.
This record formalizes their shared contract without creating another Brain, Spine, Rail,
Integration Registry, job system, or source of truth.

This is internal planning and architecture documentation only. It changes no Solo or shared-chat
code, model provider, provider state, runtime, infrastructure, tenant data, production behavior,
customer release identity, public feature promise, developer API, SDK, or Marketplace listing.

#### The five concepts that must stay separate

| Concept | Canonical meaning |
|---|---|
| **Second Brain** | Paige's governed, scoped knowledge layer: approved business facts, plans, policies, evidence, skills, and eligible lessons. `docs/brain/` is the durable architecture/governance index for that layer; runtime use still requires an authorized, tenant-safe projection. |
| **Runtime Harness** | Paige's internal operating layer: context assembly, model routing, skill/tool selection, authority, durable jobs, verification, cost controls, receipts/Rail, evaluation, and controlled improvement. It safely uses Brain knowledge; it does not replace the Brain. |
| **Paige Spine** | The governed action and authority seam. Every read or action crosses server-resolved identity, scope, policy, budget, approval, and stop rules. |
| **Rail and receipts** | Durable evidence of actions, readback, outcomes, and attribution. Rail is the safe, owner-visible evidence stream; detailed receipts remain bounded and redacted rather than becoming a raw-payload dump. |
| **Mind / Memory** | **Mind** is bounded working reasoning and evidence, not automatic durable memory. **Memory** is durable, governed, owner-confirmed knowledge only. |

The Harness is the system that lets Paige safely use Second Brain knowledge, interact through the
Spine, and turn verified experience into eligible future improvement.

#### Canonical modality-neutral path

`Chat or Live Voice → tenant-safe context assembly → model/task routing → skill/tool selection → Spine authority → canonical action → verified readback → receipt and Rail → truthful Paige response → eligible reviewed learning`

Text chat, Live Conversation, proactive operating work, Secure Browser, social operations,
research, internal Platform Operator work, and future agent experiences may have different
interaction surfaces, but they use this same governed core. Their tenant boundary, authority,
verification, evidence, and truth rules cannot differ.

No LLM, provider, MCP server, browser worker, voice provider, skill, sub-agent, or external tool may
bypass server-resolved actor, tenant, workspace, role, and scope; Paige Spine authority; configured
budget, approval, concurrency, and stop limits; canonical write and verified readback; attributable,
redacted receipt and Rail requirements; or Second Brain, Mind, and Memory eligibility rules.

#### One Paige across all capability domains

`One Paige → one shared governed runtime → coordinated work across many platform domains.`

Departments are capability domains inside the Paige Runtime Harness—not separate AI products,
separate agents with their own operating systems, or independent islands of memory and tools. A
domain may register versioned skills, scoped tools, canonical-record adapters, job handlers, and
presentation identities or specialist workers. Those registrations remain visible to the same Paige
Harness and governed through the same Second Brain, Spine, authority, canonical-record,
verification, receipt, Rail, job, evaluation, and cost-control path. No department may create its
own Brain, Harness, authority system, untracked “agent memory,” disconnected tool access, or
parallel operating logic.

The shared Harness must account for governed access across the full platform. This is a
representative, non-exhaustive integration map—not a new surface or capability registry:

- Command Center, operating direction, Missions, Strategic Plays, and plans;
- Clients, conversations, relationships, records, and follow-up;
- Campaigns, offers, content, social operations, and growth;
- Sales, pipelines, opportunities, and conversion work;
- Calendar, tasks, scheduling, and approved connections;
- Analytics, performance evidence, and decision support;
- Vibe Studio and approved creative production;
- Vault, Connected Accounts, provider connections, and future Secure Browser work;
- Settings, permissions, workspace switching, and operational configuration; and
- future Platform Operator support, tenant health, pricing/entitlements, fleet operations,
  releases, incidents, and internal Paige-company operations.

Cross-domain work is one continuous Paige-led workflow, not a chain of disconnected assistants:

`goal or conversation → campaign plan → approved content work → lead/contact update → pipeline movement → follow-up scheduling → performance readback → Rail/receipt → Paige operating brief`

Coordination breadth is not blanket authority. At each read, tool call, job step, or action, the
Harness re-resolves the active tenant, actor, workspace, role, tool scope, provider state, approval
rule, budget, and verification requirement. A later step cannot inherit broader authority merely
because an earlier step succeeded, and a domain label, specialist identity, model choice, prompt,
or hand-off cannot elevate authority. Unavailable or unauthorized steps fail closed while the
remaining safe workflow stays truthfully resumable.

This is the architecture contract, not a claim that every listed domain is currently connected.
Each domain retains its status and acceptance evidence in its existing canonical record.

#### Tenant Client Portal: MVP projection through the same Harness

The Tenant Client Portal is a client-audience surface of the one Paige Runtime Harness, not a
separate portal product, department agent, Brain, Harness, authority system, or memory. Its canonical
path is:

`Tenant business → shared governed Paige Runtime Harness → client-scoped portal experience`

For every client-facing read, message, request, approval, task, document, status update, or
Paige-assisted interaction, the Harness independently resolves the external client identity,
sponsoring tenant, explicit client-to-tenant relationship, workspace and record scope, client role
and consent, allowed shared information, tenant-defined authority and approval policy, applicable
provider/file/document state, and verification, receipt, and Rail requirements. Breadth of Paige
coordination never grants blanket client authority.

The portal receives only a deliberate, client-scoped projection of canonical tenant information and
approved shared work. It never automatically receives the tenant's full Second Brain, private Mind
or Memory, Vault, Connected Accounts, internal team conversations, other clients, financial controls,
private strategy, credentials, hidden prompts or reasoning traces, or autonomous action authority.

The owner-complete MVP vertical is:

1. Tenant owner selects or creates an existing canonical client relationship.
2. Tenant explicitly invites or grants that client portal access.
3. Client authenticates into a branded, tenant-scoped portal.
4. Client sees only approved progress, messages, requests, tasks, documents, approvals, and next steps.
5. Client may respond, ask Paige a bounded question, provide requested information, or approve/decline an item only where permitted.
6. Every meaningful action crosses the same Spine authority, canonical write, verified readback, receipt, and Rail path.
7. Tenant owner can review, revoke, or narrow access.
8. Account/client/tenant switching, expired invitations, denied access, stale links, removed relationships, and unavailable provider/document states fail closed and explain the next safe action.

**Current status: `PARTIAL`.** Current `main` contains a real external-client substrate: branded
`/portal/:tenantSlug` sign-in, `/join/:token` registration, single-tenant client linkage, the
authenticated `/app` shell, action-item responses, approval-status visibility, a platform
legal-acceptance audit list, a dedicated Paige chat surface, and client-visible activity. The complete
vertical is not proven: consumer-invite recipient binding in the final acceptance RPC; multi-workspace
client membership and switching; revocation after acceptance; canonical tenant/client conversation
and governed portal-tool execution; dedicated shared documents; client Planning/tasks; decision
controls on approval records; tenant-facing support/escalation and booking; tenant service-agreement
receipt/PDF; and authenticated isolation/denial/stale-session/recovery evidence remain unavailable,
broken, or proof owed. Tenant-side
Clients UI is management/configuration—not proof of the external-client journey. This correction
does not authorize the dedicated Client Portal MVP build.

#### Paige Self-Knowledge & Migration Advisor — canonical Harness contract

**Owner decision and current truth (2026-09-08).** Paige must lead capability questions,
platform comparisons, and migration planning from her own verified tenant-scoped powers. She is not
a generic consultant that reflexively sends a tenant to another platform. This is one internal
capability of the shared Paige Runtime Harness—not another assistant, Brain, Harness, registry,
migration database, authority system, or Rail.

The end-to-end **Paige Self-Knowledge & Migration Advisor is `UNAVAILABLE`** on current `main`.
Paige already has `PARTIAL`, distributed self-description primitives—route/tier configuration,
Spine and tool registrations, Skills Inventory, Integration Capability Registry, Surface Binding
Ledger, provider-result state, model traces/cost estimates, release history, and narrow safe
projections—but no server-owned, freshness-aware contract assembles them into an authorized answer
or governed migration plan. Historical prose is planning evidence, never current runtime truth.

The read-only advisory path is:

`verified tenant capability projection → normalized migration direction → Paige-first coverage and gaps → dated comparison → staged recoverable plan → human-readable advisory receipt`

It preserves four distinct source-of-truth layers:

1. **Paige verified capability manifest.** A derived tenant-safe projection—not a new registry—with
   capability key/name/domain; tenant/workspace/tier eligibility; delivery truth
   (`LIVE`/`PARTIAL`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`PROOF OWED`); tenant availability and source; read/draft/auto/
   confirm/prohibited authority lanes; provider and approval gates; budget/cost policy; limitations;
   evidence references; source revision; observed/freshness timestamps; conflicts; and owner-facing
   “can now / cannot yet / next gate” language. Evidence verification is a separate
   `VERIFIED`/`UNVERIFIED` dimension: `PROOF OWED` is delivery code awaiting the named proof class,
   while `UNVERIFIED` states that a particular runtime claim has not been proven. Neither is erased
   or silently promoted by the other.
2. **Tenant operating-system inventory.** Tenant-owned connected systems and declared functions,
   connection truth/evidence, workflow dependencies, data/control ownership, replacement candidates,
   authority/approval boundaries, last verification, and unknowns. It stores safe references and
   summaries—not credentials, secrets, raw workflow definitions, or private payloads.
3. **Dated comparison knowledge.** Each external claim records subject/provider, claim, source URL,
   publisher, checked-as-of date, applicable plan/edition/region, limitation/confidence, and a
   re-verification boundary. It may identify an honest competitor advantage or Paige gap, but never
   overrides Paige's verified truth or makes a provider connected, eligible, or authorized.
4. **Migration plan and evidence model.** Source system, target state, requested outcome, object
   classes, inventory/evidence references, replacement coverage, gaps, staged cutover, per-stage
   approvals/budgets, stop conditions, checkpoints, rollback/forward-fix, canonical readback,
   receipt/Rail requirements, deliberately unchanged items, and truthful status.

The manifest is a derived projection, not a circular new source. Implementations use this precedence
and fail closed rather than selecting convenient prose when sources disagree:

| Manifest field | Canonical owner | Runtime adapter and freshness/failure rule |
|---|---|---|
| Actor, tenant, workspace, tier, role, act-as, context epoch | Authenticated JWT plus server membership/role resolvers | Resolve per request and again per action; unresolved or changed scope stops. |
| Route/tier eligibility | `src/lib/routing/tierBranches.ts` + `src/lib/tier/tierFeatures.ts` | Server manifest adapter is `UNAVAILABLE`; bind source revision and fail closed on drift. |
| Spine capability and authority | `_shared/paige-spine/registry.ts` + server authority resolvers | Read current registration and authorization per step; registry presence alone grants nothing. |
| Skill/version eligibility | Canonical `paige_skills` rows + skill interpreter policy | Read active scoped/versioned rows at request time; inventory prose or missing metadata is ineligible. |
| Provider limitation vs tenant connection | Integration Registry JSON (governance) + `provider-result-contract.md` and tenant connection records (runtime) | Both are required; tenant result applies only within registry limits. Stale data preserves its last-known state plus age/stale warning and blocks decisions requiring current truth; conflicting/missing state is unavailable. |
| Surface binding | Surface Binding Ledger JSON (governance/evidence) | No authority source; cite state/revision as a limitation and require live adapter proof. |
| Model route, quality, latency, spend | `_shared/model-router.ts`, `paige_llm_trace`, and metered-event records | Use current routed result plus bounded evidence window; absent budget/quality evidence remains unknown. |
| Release identity | Exact approved release record under the release schema; Section 4 is history | Only an approved exact record supports customer-release language; absence fails closed. |

Server-resolved live tenant state outranks static eligibility/config for that tenant; static code/config
defines allowable candidates; approved governance may narrow but never fabricate runtime state.
Historical Master/Brain prose provides provenance and limitations only. Any unresolved contradiction,
stale source, missing revision, or absent adapter produces an explicit gap—not a guessed answer.

“Migration” is not one blanket operation. The plan names each affected class: model/provider route;
integration connection or API version; skill/prompt/policy version; Spine or legacy-tool path;
Marketplace capability version; tenant configuration; release/build cutover; or database/data-schema
migration. Every class defaults to **read-only advice**. Schema/data moves, provider credentials,
model-route changes, connection shutdowns, production cutovers, destructive cleanup, and other
external effects are excluded until a separately owner-authorized delivery contract names the class,
owner, approval lane, rollback, recovery, and proof.

The normalized intent records source system, target state, desired outcome, object classes, scope,
assumptions, ambiguities, and one of `off_external_to_paige`, `into_external`, `compare_only`, or
`ambiguous`. When a GHL request's direction is genuinely ambiguous, Paige asks only: **“Are we moving
off GHL into Paige-managed operations, or moving work into GHL?”** For another identified system she
uses the same minimal source↔target form with that system's verified name; if no system is identified,
she asks which system is involved. She never invents a product or infers authority from migration
language.

Paige's answer order is mandatory: **(1)** what Paige can genuinely handle now for this tenant,
**(2)** gaps, prerequisites, and unavailable/proof-owed work, **(3)** the proposed staged transition
and alternatives, **(4)** the exact approvals required before any external change, then dated
comparison evidence where useful. “Listed,” “installed,” “connected,” “eligible,” “authorized,”
“proven,” and “released” remain separate facts. Provider integration delivery, tenant connection,
surface binding, release identity, capability proof, and authority must never collapse into
“available.” With no approved release record, customer-release advice fails closed to verified
internal build facts and non-release language.

Each advisory result owes a redacted, human-readable **response artifact** naming what Paige was asked, what she
read and as-of when, what she drafted, what she changed (**none** for advisory), what she verified,
what she deliberately left unchanged, remaining gaps/unknowns, required approvals, rollback boundary,
and request/plan identifiers. In the first read-only slice it is returned inline and is **not durable
Memory or a new receipt store**. If persistence is later authorized, `_shared/capability-record.ts` /
`record_capability_run` remains the existing Rail-summary seam; the universal immutable detailed-
receipt contract is `PARTIAL` and must be approved in that shared seam before persistence. It contains
no raw tenant data, secret, credential, transcript, private workflow/browser payload, hidden prompt,
or reasoning trace. “Done,” “working on it,” or partial-step counts are never completion evidence.

If a later execution slice is explicitly authorized, the Harness must re-resolve authenticated and
effective actor, tenant, workspace, tier, role, act-as state, object scope, provider state, tool lane,
approval, budget, and context epoch before every step; run an idempotent durable job; checkpoint before
mutation; preserve the old route/tool/version until cutover verifies; perform canonical write and
readback; record redacted receipt and Rail; and expose pending/running/paused/blocked/failed/
`outcome_unknown`/verified state. Revocation or workspace switch invalidates later authority. An
ambiguous provider outcome is `outcome_unknown` and must reconcile before retry. No destructive
cleanup precedes export, compatibility, backfill, and rollback proof.

Owner correction or quality evidence may propose a versioned skill, route, prompt, or policy lesson;
it cannot auto-publish or enter durable confirmed Memory. Tenant data, private comparisons, raw logs,
and one tenant's confidential operating knowledge never become cross-tenant learning.

**Maturity gate.** A first callable server-owned read-only advisor is `PROOF OWED` until authenticated
tenant/workspace/tier/role isolation, stale/conflict handling, source citation, approval denial,
account switching, receipts, and regressions are proven. Migration execution remains separately
`UNAVAILABLE` until each authorized effect proves durable orchestration, canonical readback,
Rail/receipt, rollback/recovery, and honest partial or unknown outcomes.

**Affected-flow and collision assessment.** The architecture covers capability questions, tenant
system inventory, ambiguous or explicit replacement direction, dated comparisons, advisory plans,
and a later separately authorized execution/recovery flow. First-use, empty, loading, stale,
conflicting, disconnected, denied, unavailable, account-switch, cancellation, retry, rollback, and
`outcome_unknown` states all fail closed with the next safe action. Active shared-chat/scroll,
Text-chat Skills/Intentful Interview, Live Conversation, Secure Browser, Tenant Brain/Campaign Brief,
Platform account choice, release/customer-update, social/Metricool, model/cost, orchestration/Rail,
and Client Portal workstreams retain their owners and acceptance criteria. The dedicated
Self-Knowledge & Migration Advisor implementation owner consumes this contract; this documentation
lane does not edit or absorb UI, chat, runtime, provider, migration, or production files. Canonical
record overlaps are resolved by rebasing on current `main` and preserving newer shipped-log, Harness,
Live Conversation, portal, and shared-chat truth.

Current concrete ownership checked 2026-09-08: merged #1068 is the canonical Live Conversation
base. Active overlaps remain #754 (Master/Brain/wiring), #917 (Master/config/Spine/chat/jobs), #1044
(binding ledger/chat/skills), #572 (model router/trace/metering), #576/#591 (chat/knowledge
isolation), #1040/#729 (Master/decision/Rail), #921 (competing agent-registry framing), #1046
(Secure Browser), and #670 (Marketplace release). Their product/runtime files remain outside this
architecture branch.

#### Paige-owned Harness responsibilities

1. **Context assembly:** build the minimum tenant/workspace-safe context for the task from
   authorized canonical records, eligible Brain knowledge, bounded Mind evidence, and governed
   Memory; fail closed on unresolved identity, ambiguity, stale scope, or unavailable sources.
2. **Model routing:** route by task and modality behind a provider-neutral contract; control
   fallback, quality, latency, capability eligibility, and spend. Provider products and model names
   are replaceable configuration, never Paige's identity.
3. **Skill lifecycle:** register versioned skills with explicit purpose, inputs, eligible tiers,
   allowed tools, policies, evaluation evidence, and retirement state. Inventory does not equal
   runtime eligibility.
4. **Tool authority:** enforce registered tools, budgets, scopes, approval rules, attribution,
   concurrency, and stop conditions at the server-owned Spine—not in prompts or pixels.
5. **Durable work:** orchestrate jobs with idempotent claims, retry limits, recovery, cancellation,
   visible status, and honest terminal states; arbitrary agent-to-agent chat is not the operating
   system.
6. **Verification and truth:** verify canonical readback and material side effects before reporting
   success; distinguish accepted, failed, unavailable, and proof-owed results.
7. **Evidence and operations:** create receipts and Rail, correlate release identity, runtime traces,
   costs, incidents, recovery, and provider health without exposing secrets or raw private content.
8. **Mind and Memory eligibility:** keep working evidence ephemeral or bounded unless a separately
   authorized durable-memory contract admits an owner-confirmed item with provenance, scope,
   correction, and deletion semantics.
9. **Evaluation and improvement:** combine outcome evidence, owner feedback, quality scoring, and
   versioned evaluations so a reviewed skill, route, prompt, or policy can improve without silent
   self-modification.

#### Current-state inventory refreshed at `main` `610e609c` (2026-09-08)

| Capability | Status | Grounded current truth / next gate |
|---|---|---|
| Dedicated Paige workspace/chat and session/context behavior | `PARTIAL` | The tenant-aware workspace, persistent threads, account-switch fences, and transcript ownership exist. Context assembly remains distributed. **Chat-scroll P0 reopened:** the owner reproduced delayed position theft after #1057/#1066 acceptance. Indefinite manual ownership remains FAIL pending corrective release and fresh authenticated owner acceptance. Other workstreams continue undisturbed. |
| Spine authority and registered-tool path | `PARTIAL` | The Spine registry, action-risk policy, approval/autonomy substrate, governed execution seam, and MCP tool door exist. Not every chat, skill, job, browser, voice, or external-tool path is proven to use one complete contract. |
| Canonical-record readback and truthful success | `PARTIAL` | Mission and Campaign Brief flows establish the write → scoped readback → Rail pattern. Universal enforcement and authenticated proof across all mutations remain owed. |
| Rail and detailed receipts | `PARTIAL` | Rail and capability-run evidence cover bounded paths. A universal, correlated, redacted detailed-receipt contract across all Harness work is not live. |
| Second Brain, Tenant Brain, Mind, Memory, and skills inventory | `PARTIAL` | Durable doctrine, Tenant Brain composition, bounded Mind projections, Memory contracts/stores, and the skills inventory exist at different maturity levels. Proposed durable rows are not eligible confirmed Memory; the confirmed-only runtime projection and integration are `UNAVAILABLE`, with proof owed only after implementation exists. Inventory or storage presence does not prove runtime reach or evaluation. |
| Text-chat Skills / Intentful Interview | `UNAVAILABLE` | The active MVP workstream owns its shared-chat files and acceptance criteria. Its candidate branch is not on current `main` and is not absorbed by this record; authenticated durable-state, Rail, abandonment, and regression evidence remain its gate. |
| Live Conversation architecture and provider gates | `PARTIAL` | PR #1053 landed the provider-neutral UI/control plane and governance contract; merged PR #1068 adds the organic Paige Presence and actual played-output reaction. Provider-backed realtime audio remains `PROOF OWED` until provider scope/privacy/cost and authenticated end-to-end proof gates are met; local test audio is not provider speech. |
| Secure Browser control plane and worker boundary | `UNAVAILABLE` | Public bounded research and the prerequisite security foundation exist, but the customer capability does not. Credentialed browsing, provider sessions, Connected Accounts, worker authority proof, budgets, and detailed receipts remain unavailable or proof-owed in the separately owned MVP workstream. |
| Durable background work, retry, recovery, and visible job state | `PARTIAL` | The action bus, scheduled workers, claims, retries, alert evaluation, and several job records exist. They are not yet one uniformly governed, owner-visible Harness job contract. |
| Model routing, provider fallback, spend, and latency controls | `PARTIAL` | The shared router has task/modality routing, allowlists, fallback, traces, latency, and cost estimates. Universal provider coverage, enforced per-task/tenant spend ceilings, and correlated quality gates remain owed. Estimates are not budget enforcement. |
| Evaluation, feedback, skill versioning, quality scoring, experience-to-skill learning | `UNAVAILABLE` | Trace/evaluation, prompt-memory, skills, forge, and critique substrates are partial foundations. The complete owner-reviewed experience → evaluation → versioned approved skill/routing/prompt/policy loop is not available, and no change may publish automatically. |
| Proactive monitoring and operating-brief runtime | `PARTIAL` | Systems Check, operating context/memory, alerts, scheduled workers, and the action bus provide real substrate. Uniform triggers, authoring, delivery/escalation, recovery, and owner-visible work state remain incomplete. |
| Observability, release awareness, cost/metering, and incident/recovery controls | `PARTIAL` | Traces, audit, Rail, Systems Check, alerting, metering, deployment tags, the Section 4 shipped log, and release-aware UI exist. They are not yet one end-to-end correlated Harness control plane. |

#### Agentization audit, canonical roster, and activation order

The full current-state classification, domain-to-skill-to-tool-to-specialist
matrix, delegation path, activation roadmap, and collision map live in
`docs/doctrine/paige-os-architecture.md` §6. The specialist operating
contracts live in the existing
`docs/doctrine/paige-c-suite-roster.md` Part 5. Skill maturity and the
controlled Skills Steward loop live in
`docs/brain/paige-skills-inventory.md`. These extend existing
canonical homes; they do not create an agent registry, second C-suite, duplicate
Skills catalogue, Brain, Harness, Spine, Rail, authority system, tenant context,
or public navigation.

The proposed first activation cohort **after** the central Harness completion
gate is Operating Strategy and Planning, Research and Intelligence, Cost and
Usage Advisor, and Skills Steward. Initial lanes are read, analyze, draft, and
propose only. Their present truth remains `PARTIAL`, `PARTIAL`,
`PARTIAL`, and `UNAVAILABLE`; roadmap order is not activation.
Client Success, Growth, Sales, Creative Production, and future Platform Operator
roles remain behind their domain, provider, authority, record/readback,
evidence, evaluation, and workstream gates.

Vibe Studio Creative Production is one Paige-assembled, temporary job team—not
seven customer-facing assistants. Its bounded roles are Creative Brief and Strategy Specialist; Funnel and
Conversion Copy Specialist; Forms and Conversion Flow Specialist; Long-Form
Publishing Specialist; Visual Asset Specialist; provider-neutral Video
Production Adapter; and
Creative Quality Reviewer. Canonical flow:

`Owner request → server-derived tenant/workspace/actor context → Paige assembles approved specialist job team → scoped skills/tools → drafts and versions → quality review → owner approval → separately authorized publish/provider execution → verified receipt/Rail outcome`

Existing Vibe Studio creative-authoring/session/version capability is a `PARTIAL`
substrate. Binding Ledger `campaigns.vibe-studio`, the Paige/Harness Studio
binding, and all seven roles remain `UNAVAILABLE` for activation. NEXUS owns the
growth/creative business domain, MENTOR owns Studio platform/config/readiness,
and Paige orchestrates the bounded temporary team. First future MVP order is
(1) Creative Brief and Strategy Specialist plus Creative Quality Reviewer;
(2) Funnel and Conversion Copy Specialist plus
Forms and Conversion Flow Specialist; (3) Long-Form Publishing Specialist plus Visual Asset Specialist;
and (4) Video Production Adapter after provider, rights, security, budget and
evidence gates. Workers
are temporary, minimum-context and budget-bound within one owner conversation
with Paige; Paige selects a fixed approved role set for one bounded brief, not
seven permanent agents. Higgsfield is an unverified provider-neutral adapter
example only, not an Integration Registry, connection, authority or availability
claim. The first proof pins skills/tools/budget/concurrency, creates attributed
drafts in canonical artifact lineage, verifies matching artifact/version ids by
readback, records attributable job receipts/Rail, runs and canonically records a
role-specific approved creative evaluation with reviewer attribution, and only
then returns one owner bundle. Provider-backed draft generation, when needed,
first receives its own Spine/provider/budget/approval decision, result readback
and generation receipt. Outputs remain versioned drafts until owner approval;
later publication, send, upload or live-site action requires a fresh Spine
decision, canonical readback and effect receipt/Rail. Denial, tenant/account
switch, retry, cancellation and provider-unavailable paths must fail closed.

Secure Browser and Live Conversation are execution/modality layers, not
assistant identities. The Tenant Client Portal is an MVP platform domain and
client-scoped experience, not an agent. PR #921's proposed
`paige-agent-registry.md` is a competing canonical home and must not be
treated as current doctrine; useful evidence must be reconciled into the
existing homes above.

#### Controlled improvement, never silent self-modification

`task context → routed model and skill → governed execution → verified outcome → owner correction or quality signal → proposed lesson → evaluation → versioned approved skill, routing, prompt, or policy improvement`

The Harness must not permit raw transcript ingestion as automatic durable memory; credentials,
cookies, private browser content, or page content entering model context by default; one tenant's
confidential business information becoming platform-wide learning; arbitrary agent-to-agent chat as
the operating system; or unreviewed prompt, skill, routing, or policy changes entering production.
Platform learning may use only properly governed, scoped, approved, anonymized, or aggregate
evidence.

#### Platform Operator dogfood-first sequence and future product boundary

1. Complete active Solo MVP, hotfix, and shared-chat collision work.
2. Formalize internal Harness contracts without duplicating Spine, Brain, Rail, or the Integration
   Capability Registry.
3. Build and use the Platform Operator Shell as Paige's internal operating environment.
4. Dogfood the Harness through actual Paige operations: support, campaigns, internal strategy,
   provider management, releases, controlled research, and approved proactive work.
5. Prove tenant isolation, permissions, quality evaluation, spend visibility, recovery, and evidence
   behavior.
6. Only after documented dogfood acceptance, assess a developer SDK/API, Marketplace extension, or
   hosted Harness offering.

The future opportunity is a provider-neutral **Paige Runtime Harness SDK and/or hosted API**, not a
copy of Paige and not access to Paige customer data. A future developer may bring and govern their
own models and provider credentials; knowledge adapters and storage; tools and connected apps;
users, tenants, permissions, budgets, and policies; and evaluations, receipts, and operational
evidence.

Any future product must never expose Paige tenant Brain data, cross-tenant context, Paige customer
records, internal Platform Operator data, proprietary Paige playbooks unless separately licensed
and explicitly authorized, raw credentials, private browser content, hidden system prompts, or
internal reasoning traces. This is a Platform Operator and later product opportunity, not a current
Solo customer promise.

#### Affected-flow and collision assessment (documentation-only)

- **Actor and goal:** the owner and future Paige builders need one durable governing contract before
  adding model, agent, skill, voice, browser, job, or external-tool work.
- **Affected flow:** architecture discovery and delivery routing only. The record maps every future
  surface to the same context → routing → authority → action → verification → evidence → reviewed
  learning flow; no runtime flow changes in this delivery.
- **Canonical ownership:** this Master section owns the Harness decision. The Second Brain, Spine and
  Rail state, Memory contract, skills inventory, Integration Capability Registry, release policy,
  and workstream delivery records retain their narrower facts and are linked, not copied or forked.
- **Active shared-file/workstream boundaries:** text-chat Skills/Intentful Interview; Live
  Conversation; Secure Browser; Tenant Brain/Campaign Brief;
  Platform account choice; release/customer-update behavior; and Metricool/social exploration keep
  their current owners, launch scope, provider state, and acceptance criteria. This architecture
  delivery modifies none of their code or evidence. The shared chat-scroll workstream is closed at
  owner-accepted #1057; `PaigeAIChat` must not receive another scroll-seam change unless a new
  reproducible defect is reported.
- **Documentation collision:** concurrent canonical-record work that changes this Master,
  `docs/brain/README.md`, `docs/brain/decision-log.md`, or
  `docs/brain/paige-brain-wiring-standard.md` must rebase and preserve this ruling. The
  agentization audit refresh starts from `main` `610e609c`. Current GitHub inventory confirms direct
  collisions with #921 (competing registry), #1044 (text-chat Skills/Game Plan), #1046 (Secure
  Browser), #917 (orchestration/tools), #729/#776 (Spine/Rail), and #754/#1040 (Brain/doctrine);
  their product and historical-record ownership remains separate.
- **Regression map:** no new source of truth; no customer/runtime capability promoted by
  documentation; no provider named as Paige's identity; no bypass around server identity, Spine,
  budgets, readback, receipts/Rail, or Memory eligibility; no active workstream absorbed.
- **Release boundary:** internal architecture/governance documentation only. It earns no customer
  version, name, What's New item, announcement, deployment, or production-behavior claim.

**Routing:** before model, agent, skill, voice, browser, proactive-job, or external-tool work, read
this section, `docs/brain/paige-brain-wiring-standard.md`,
`docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md`, `docs/brain/paige-memory-contract.md`, and—when an external
provider or connected app is involved—`docs/integration-registry/README.md`. Platform Operator work
also reads `docs/architecture/platform-operator-tenant-200.md`. Current delivery status still comes
from Section 4 and the relevant detailed record, never from this architecture decision alone.

### Capability Portfolio — the One Paige Operating Platform rule (owner-approved 2026-09-12)

**The rule.** Paige is one AI COO, not a collection of disconnected apps. Every capability —
Calendar, Social, Vibe, CRM, Client Portal, Marketplace, browser research, sandbox work, skills,
agents, billing, analytics, automations, and every future domain — plugs into the same shared
governed path. A capability that reaches a provider, a record, or an owner by any other route is not
a faster capability; it is an ungoverned one, and it does not ship.

**The required capability entry path (binding on every domain, every tier, every modality):**

`Capability Gateway → tenant/actor/role/connection truth → authority / approval / budget / policy
checks → domain adapter or canonical write → readback / reconciliation → receipt + Rail → truthful
Paige explanation and owner control`

This is the same governed core as the canonical modality-neutral path recorded above; the Gateway
naming states the entry obligation explicitly so no domain can read "my surface is different" into
it. **Nothing in this rule grants authority.** Breadth of coordination is never breadth of
permission: at every read, tool call, job step and act, the Harness re-resolves tenant, actor,
workspace, role, tool scope, provider state, approval rule, budget and verification requirement, and
a later step never inherits a wider authority because an earlier one succeeded.

**Division of labour (who builds what).**

- **The Harness** builds the roads, power grid, authority, event engine, receipts, proof, budgets and
  specialist runtime. Its per-layer state is `docs/delivery/harness-completion-map.md` (Layers A–G).
- **Chat** builds the owner cockpit through which the owner discovers, directs, approves, monitors
  and understands the system.
- **Domain teams** build their domain capabilities **on those shared primitives**.

**Prohibited by this rule — a domain may not create its own:** Harness · authority or execution
engine · tool registry · job or scheduler system · browser system · evidence or receipt stream ·
provider registry · memory · orchestrator. This restates, and does not replace, the existing
"One Paige across all capability domains" contract above and
`docs/brain/paige-brain-wiring-standard.md` §1.

**The 200-capability portfolio is OWNER-APPROVED PRODUCT DIRECTION — binding, not aspirational.**
The long-term target is a large portfolio of capabilities inside one governed platform, not two
hundred independently-architected products each with its own runtime and its own idea of the truth.
It is a portfolio, never 200 apps. **Capability count measures reach across one platform; it is never
a licence to fork the platform.**

> **Every portfolio capability remains intended product direction; each becomes real only through the
> shared Harness path and its domain-specific completion proof.**

**Its canonical home is `docs/doctrine/paige-capability-portfolio.md`** — the one owner-vision
artifact. It preserves the capability families and their intended outcomes and maps each family to
its domain and shared Harness dependencies. It **claims no runtime availability**, and it is **not**
a second Binding Ledger, Integration Capability Registry, Spine registry, or roadmap tracker: for
current status and delivery proof it points at those records, which own those answers.

**Two guardrails on the number itself (§13).** (1) "200" is **never** a delivery-percentage or
`LIVE`-coverage score — there is no "we are at N/200," because the portfolio is intent and the
canonical records hold reality. (2) Runtime truth, provider status, surface binding and delivery
state are **never duplicated** out of their owning records into the portfolio artifact; it cites
them. Scope is binding; **availability is only ever what the owning record proves.**

**The truthful completion rule.** A capability is complete only when a real owner or client outcome
is reachable through the path above and proven at the evidence class claimed. Explicitly, **none of
these is completion**: a component renders · a tool exists in a registry · a fixture or structural
test passes · a provider name appears in documentation · a config flag is set · a migration merged ·
a preview deploys · a prior agent's report says so. Evidence classes and their honest labels
(`LIVE` / `PARTIAL` / `UNAVAILABLE` / `UNVERIFIED`, plus the ledger's `PROOF_OWED` and
`INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED`) are already defined in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/doctrine/paige-ui-delivery-standard.md`
and `docs/binding-ledger/README.md` — this rule adds no vocabulary and forks none.

**Routing.** Which canonical home answers which capability question — and what proof each portfolio
family owes — is `docs/doctrine/paige-capability-portfolio.md`. That artifact is the owner-vision
portfolio plus a routing and sequencing map: it cites the Binding Ledger, Integration Capability Registry, Spine, Rail and
Harness Completion Map, and replaces none of them (§18).

### Integration Capability Registry (provider-governance delivery record — MANDATORY)

**`docs/integration-registry/`** (README + `integration-capability-registry.json`, the source of
truth) is the one authoritative, living catalogue + taxonomy of every third-party provider, API,
connector, Marketplace service, and external-execution platform Paige may use, and how each is
governed (taxonomy · tier eligibility · authority lane · M1 metering dependency · canonical provider
receipt · Rail/Mind/Memory boundary · honest status). **Cardinal rule: listing a provider there never
means it is connected, available, or autonomous.** **Delivery rule (MANDATORY, §0/§66/§BRAIN.3):**
before proposing, implementing, opening a PR for, or changing ANY provider integration, read the
relevant registry entry; before merge, update it with the actual capability/authority/proof/limits/next
owner in the same commit. Enforced by `npm run lint:integration-registry` (CI). Distinct from
`config-registry.md` (wiring names/IDs), `provider-result-contract.md` (runtime per-tenant state into
Systems Check), and the Spine `registry.ts` / `tenant_mcp_connections` code registries (§18).

### Release Governance & Customer Update Policy (MANDATORY)

**`docs/doctrine/release-governance-and-customer-update-policy.md`** is the canonical release contract.
It separates exact internal build identity, release channel, and an earned customer release identity;
sets `0.x.y` for the Paige Solo Preview/founding period; defines patch/minor/major semantics, the
customer announcement gate, required What's New format, truthful status language, machine-readable
record schema, and the bounded future Updates UI direction. It does not replace this Master Project
Reference or any domain ledger; it governs how their facts become release and customer claims.

## 4. What's SHIPPED (stop asking about these)

> **Solo Beta acquisition + live billing binding — shipped foundation (2026-09-13).** Public enrollment is Solo-only: a server-verified 30-day trial, then `$74.50/month` unless canceled before the first paid renewal. PR #1200 bound the sole canonical offer to the verified live Stripe Product/Price, deployed live-only Checkout/webhook/entitlement enforcement, and preserved existing authorized non-Solo access. Production database, Edge, Vercel, provider-catalog/webhook, fail-closed API, and signed-out rendered proof are verified. The first real authorized customer Checkout, signed fulfillment, exactly-one tenant/membership/entitlement/receipt readback, current-shell entry, lifecycle recovery, and live Billing Portal remain `PROOF OWED`; therefore the owner-drivable end-to-end capability remains `PARTIAL`, not falsely `LIVE`. Authority: [Solo Beta acquisition evidence](evidence/ui-delivery/solo-beta-acquisition.md).

> **Established login workspace choice + stale-checkout recovery — shipped (2026-09-13).** PR #1219 (`4bc9cf771e992614701d6f4e1b94f1d5c3d513d6`) restores the existing server-derived account/workspace card after every fresh login for any identity with an active direct membership, including one-workspace legacy and promotional Solo identities. Multiple memberships remain separately selectable; Platform remains an explicit authorized peer context. Stale Solo intent and `/welcome?checkout=success|recovery` can no longer override established access, and one-workspace users are not silently auto-entered. The current production descendant `c287a4f86ad42f35903a7dc297012514e1480c8a` contains the repair unchanged; Vercel is `READY`, `solo-beta-enrollment-status` is deployed, and current `edge-live` `d33f67180f2a55691e55dec39fd807610d71fc63` is a descendant of the hotfix with no scoped Edge drift. Authenticated legacy/promotional sign-in, card selection, persisted switching, refresh, and repeat-login proof remain `PROOF OWED`; no Stripe, billing, entitlement, tenant, membership, migration, or unsupported-enrollment behavior changed. Authority: [login workspace-choice recovery evidence](evidence/ui-delivery/login-workspace-choice-recovery.md).

### 4.0 Shipped Delivery Log

**2026-09-13 web_fetch hardened tenant-safe routing — a dead client-seat chat tool made functional + the shared fetch SSRF-hardened (PR [#1227](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1227), squash-merged to `main` as [`1a5d8020`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/1a5d80208c54e94723a21dcf58902b71efaa0a48); internal build identity `1a5d8020`; release channel **production** (edge-deployed via `deploy-edge-functions`); classification **internal-only**; Gate A):**
Owner ruled 2026-09-13: do NOT retire `web_fetch`; build it as a hardened routing slice for the client seat too. It was in `CLIENT_SEAT_ALLOW` and advertised to clients but the handler was **inert** (`"Web fetch not executed in this flow"`) — an advertised-but-dead capability (§13/§70 gap). **Two changes, each on a proven one-home seam (§18): (1)** `fetch-url-content` now routes its outbound fetch through the canonical `_shared/ssrfGuard.ts safeFetch` instead of a per-hostname regex blocklist — closing the DNS→private / IPv4-mapped-IPv6 / link-local bypasses (validates every resolved IP numerically), refusing redirects, and bounding time+bytes; adds `title`/`truncated` provenance and maps every `SsrfError` to an honest stable reason+status. The response contract (`{success,url,content}`) is preserved so the auto-fetch path, `paige-deep-research`, and the CI mocks are unaffected (§37 inventory complete). **(2)** the `web_fetch` chat tool handler is now functional: routes to the hardened `fetch-url-content`, **fences** the attacker-controlled page body (`RETRIEVED_KNOWLEDGE_UNTRUSTED_NOTICE` + `sanitizeUntrustedText`) before it re-enters the model, returns provenance `{url,title,fetched_at,truncated}`, reports refusal/failure honestly (never a fabricated page), bounds each fetch by `min(15s, remaining turn budget)` (skips once the turn's wall-clock is spent), and takes NO identity from the tool args. The client portal gains working link-fetch. Nothing removed (§58 — `web_fetch` stays declared + non-confirm). | **Merged + edge-deployed.** §32.a PERSISTED: `deploy-edge-functions` moved `edge-live` to [`1a5d8020`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/1a5d80208c54e94723a21dcf58902b71efaa0a48); `edge-live..main` on `supabase/functions` is **empty (zero drift)** — `paige-ai-chat` + `fetch-url-content` live on prod.

**2026-09-13 PAIGE Chat Runtime Correctness Phase 0 — three silent runtime defects in `paige-ai-chat`, regrounded (PR [#576](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/576), squash-merged to `main` as [`d33f6718`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/d33f67180f2a55691e55dec39fd807610d71fc63); internal build identity `d33f6718`; release channel **production** (edge-deployed via `deploy-edge-functions`); classification **patch**; Gate A):**
Owner-authorized 2026-09-13 drive of the long-parked #576. Three same-class defects in `supabase/functions/paige-ai-chat/index.ts` — an identifier used where nothing declares it, a runtime `ReferenceError` swallowed by a surrounding `catch`: **(1)** `runGeneralDocumentExtraction` was CALLED but never DEFINED → every general-document turn threw and no extraction proposal was ever produced; implemented against the already-shipped `ExtractionProposal` → `data:{extraction_proposal}` SSE → `ExtractionProposalCard` contract, fabricating nothing (no readable content / failed call / unparseable / nothing found all resolve to honest `null`), every emitted key a canonical `paige-write-back` `field_path`, coaching-generic (§2, no finance; no SSN/DOB §9/§13); the call-site catch now nulls the proposal and logs at error. **(2)** the tenant domain-identity read used out-of-scope `admin` → threw on every turn, identity never reached the prompt; now read through the caller's JWT-scoped `supabaseClient` (`resolve_tenant_domain_identity` self-scopes off `auth.uid()`; only `service_role` may pass a tenant) — a §9 tightening. **(3)** the KB-save path assigned an undeclared `result` → the save succeeded, the assignment threw, the branch reported failure on every genuine save; the binding is now declared. **REGROUND:** #576's original base (`00108e45`) was an orphaned pre-squash commit sharing no ancestor with current `main`, so it was regrounded onto `main` — the three repairs + their `__checks__` preserved EXACTLY, no capability-truth or other in-flight work absorbed (owner directive). | **Merged + edge-deployed.** §32.a PERSISTED: `deploy-edge-functions` moved `edge-live` to [`d33f6718`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/d33f67180f2a55691e55dec39fd807610d71fc63); `edge-live..main` on `supabase/functions` is **empty (zero drift)** — `paige-ai-chat` live on prod. Required CI green: `Validate UI delivery evidence` (N/A backend-only), `audit`, Vercel. §32 proof: the `__checks__` suite **22/22** (scope via the TS compiler + behavioural importing+EXECUTING the real `index.ts` with an injected model seam + the field-catalog contract), and anti-vacuity reproduces all three defects against the pre-fix (current-`main`) source. **§5 compliance SHIP**; **§39 adversarial peer SOUND** and caught one reground artifact — a now-stale "UNREACHABLE AT RUNTIME" comment on the domain-identity read that fix 2 invalidated — folded before merge; plus the NB-1 in-file run-command flag. `deno check` (authoritative edge type gate) is owed to CI (no local Deno) — the behavioural import executing + the scope probe are the local proxies. `verify`/`Supabase Preview` red are the pre-existing non-required baseline (stash-verified identical without this change: deno-client TS + governance-lint baseline; and the historical `disputes` DDL on every preview branch — this PR adds **zero** migrations). | **PROOF OWED (§32.c/§70):** the authenticated live-drive of the three repaired flows (a general-doc upload renders an extraction proposal · the tenant domain identity reaches the prompt · a genuine KB-save reports success) — owed to a browser-capable session; no isolated test tenant headless. **End-to-end (corrected per §39/Codex review on #1221):** the frontend ALREADY consumes this — `PaigeAIChat.tsx` parses the `data:{extraction_proposal}` SSE frame (L993) and renders `ExtractionProposalCard` (L1624; `applyExtraction` on confirm/skip), with `PaigeAIChat.documentProposal.test.tsx` exercising it — so #576's server-side fix COMPLETES a working end-to-end general-document extraction-proposal flow (server emits → client renders the field-by-field confirm card → the confirmed fields write; the authenticated live-drive is still §32.c PROOF OWED). #576's original "no frontend parses it yet" note referenced the retired `PaigeChat.tsx`, not the live `PaigeAIChat.tsx`, and was wrong. This clears the shared `index.ts`/`PaigeAIChat.tsx` collision for the remaining Chat-completion slices. | **No.** Internal chat-correctness patch; no provider action, no customer release record.

**2026-09-13 Paige Runtime Harness · Layer C · C5 (slice 1) — the approval-executor: drive a HELD native act to execution on human approval (PR [#1212](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1212), squash-merged to `main` as [`790b456d`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/790b456d70ae863393d0cb996bcc1160b8ef8370); internal build identity `790b456d`; migration `20270202000000`; release channel **production**; classification **internal-only** (dormant mechanism); Gate A):**
The final Layer-C gap: a `confirm`-lane / high-risk-clamped act lands `approval_pending` in `paige_act_executions` and, until C5, DEAD-ENDED — nothing advanced it on approval. C5 ships the execution mechanism + the ONE approve door, reusing shipped machinery WITHOUT weakening the C4 monotonic contract. **(1) Guarded approve RPC** (`paige_approve_act_execution`, migration `20270202000000`) — the SOLE sanctioned `approval_pending → accepted_for_execution` transition; `approval_pending` stays FINAL for the generic monotonic RPC (C4 untouched) so a re-drain can never clobber; SECURITY DEFINER, service-role-only in-body (`auth.uid() IS NULL`, §59), idempotent. **(2) The executor** (`_shared/paige-orchestration/approve-executor.ts`) — re-resolves availability THROUGH the canonical Gateway (never cached/literal, C2 correction); re-runs the ONE governed pathway with the human's yes as the approval claim → `execute`; atomically redeems; dispatches the native adapter; advances the ledger executed|failed|ambiguous + files receipt + owner Rail (suppressed on a no-op). NATIVE only (an n8n-sourced held act → `not_supported_in_slice`, never fired). RESUMABLE + honest: IMMUTABLE snapshot args (the engine snapshots governed args into `detail.snapshot_args` at `approval_pending`; the executor dispatches that snapshot + the ledger's own `capability_key`, never the mutable act row — closes a §70.2 confused-deputy); a post-dispatch ledger-write failure returns the PRIOR persisted state, never the adapter outcome (§13); `ambiguous`/`accepted` reconcile by correlation on re-approval, never blind re-fired. **(3) execute-approval delegation** (the ONE approve door, §18) — orchestration-sourced approvals (`metadata.source='paige_orchestration'`) delegate to the executor after the existing atomic claim; it consumes `executed|failed` ONLY (every non-terminal outcome releases the claim, stays reclaimable). The MCP `decide_pending_approval` door refuses orchestration rows (routes to the one seam). Comms/ACK paths untouched (§58). **Dormant** until slice-2 minting emits such rows. | **Merged; NO owner-visible behavior yet** (a dormant mechanism + a dormant door). Reviews on the final committed diff (MESSAGE A): **§5 compliance SHIP** (4 non-blocking notes); **§39 adversarial peer** SOUND on the load-bearing claims and found ONE blocking regression — a cross-tenant outcome-enum DISCLOSURE (the tenant-authorization guard echoed `row.outcome` before the resumable gate, consumable by the door as a real attempt) — FIXED (constant non-terminal sentinel) + regression-tested, and the fix delta re-reviewed CLEAN; one non-blocking §68 note (accepted-resume skips the availability re-check — matches engine phase-5; documented + tracked). A local `deno check` (§32 runtime typecheck) caught 2 Deno-strict edge errors the green vitest/tsc masked (`ApproveExecutorDb`→optional-args rpc; execute-approval `admin as unknown as ApproveExecutorDb`) → FIXED (`deno check` EXIT 0 on all 3 affected entrypoints). §32.a PERSISTED: `deploy-edge-functions` **success**, `edge-live` at [`790b456d`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/790b456d70ae863393d0cb996bcc1160b8ef8370), ZERO edge drift (execute-approval + orchestration graph + paige-mcp live); `deploy-migrations` `supabase db push` + `migration list` verify confirmed prod **caught up** (`20270202000000` recorded remotely → the migration IS applied), and after two transient GitHub-infra failures on the drift-tag push (a 500, then a `startup_failure`) a workflow re-run re-synced `db-live` → `790b456d` — ZERO migration drift. Required CI green (PAIGE Spine contract incl. pgTAP database-contract, Security Audit, migration-lint, ui-delivery-evidence). Test proof: vitest **109/109** across the 6 orchestration suites (resume/recovery + immutable-args + ledger-write-failure + the §39-P2 disclosure regression); tsc **14=14** (zero in C5 files); the non-required `verify` red is the same pre-existing `src/solo/*` + `signupMobile` baseline. | **PROOF OWED (§13/§32.c/§70):** (a) a direct MCP prod object-query of `paige_approve_act_execution` + a `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` transition proof — Supabase MCP is permission-denied THIS session (owed to a capable session; the CI `migration list` caught-up verify transitively proves the function exists — a failed `CREATE FUNCTION` would have errored the push and left the version unrecorded); (b) the authenticated approve→execute drive — owed once slice-2 minting surfaces a held act (never a real customer record headless). SCOPE (§13): the execution core + door, unit-proven, dormant. **Slice 2** = companion-minting into `paige_pending_approvals` (+ a §37 producer inventory) + the tracked follow-ups: §68 availability re-resolution on the accepted-resume re-dispatch, a durable ambiguous-reconcile sweeper, and release-claim-on-final-stamp-failure. | **No.** Internal engine/adapter slice; no provider action, no customer release record.

**2026-09-13 Paige Runtime Harness · Layer C · C4 — reusable ActionAdapter contract + exact state semantics LOCKED (PR [#1208](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1208), squash-merged to `main` as [`2286e3ec`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/2286e3ec5c7bb4048ac04684346c01854454c17e); internal build identity `2286e3ec5c7bb4048ac04684346c01854454c17e`; release channel **production**; classification **internal-only**; Gate A):**
C1 built the ledger + monotonic RPC, C2 the native adapter, C3 the n8n adapter — so most of C4's mandate (*"fail-closed unsupported; one `paige_act_executions` ledger; exact state semantics"*) was already delivered. C4 closed the genuine UNPROTECTED invariants, with **no new engine and no migration**: (1) **ONE HOME** for the outcome vocabulary + FINAL/SETTLED set (`_shared/paige-orchestration/outcomes.ts`, §18) — the vocabulary had lived in FOUR hand-maintained copies (`decide.ts` `ActOutcome`, the SQL domain `paige_act_outcome`, `engine.ts` `FINAL_OR_SETTLED`, the SQL `_final` array) with no drift guard; `ActOutcome` + `FINAL_OR_SETTLED` now DERIVE from the one module, `ActOutcome` re-exported so importers are unchanged (§58). (2) **Bidirectional TS↔SQL drift guard** — the decide test parses the already-shipped migration `20270126000000` and asserts SQL domain == `ACT_OUTCOMES` AND SQL `_final` == `FINAL_OUTCOMES`, set-for-set, both directions (the F5 registry-sync pattern applied to state semantics; replaces the prior one-way substring check that never covered `_final`). A drift here is a real correctness bug (a state final in the RPC but advanceable in the engine strands a row that can never settle; the reverse drops a reconcile). (3) **Uniform contract-conformance suite** across every registered adapter (native + n8n): kind round-trip, `resolveCapability` exact (own→non-null + the one `paige_act_executions` channel; foreign→null), fail-closed unsupported (unknown/blank/null→null adapter), `DispatchResult.outcome` ⊆ vocabulary — plus a **self-enforcing coverage meta-assertion** (`registeredAdapterKinds()` exported; a newly-registered adapter FAILS the suite until covered) and a **true compile-time exhaustiveness** lock (`Record<DispatchResult["outcome"], true>`). | **Merged; NO customer-facing behavior, NO runtime behavior change** — a contract/vocabulary consolidation; the engine's runtime logic and the deployed drainer's behavior are identical (`FINAL_OR_SETTLED` still holds the same 10 members, `ActOutcome` the same type). Reviews on the final diff: **§39 peer SOUND** (zero confirmed defects; hand-traced the regexes, derived sets, re-export/Deno `verbatimModuleSyntax` compat, conformance, §58, §9/§59); **§5 SHIP** (even FALSIFIED the guard — injected `phantom_drift` → 2 tests failed). Three non-blocking review notes folded in pre-merge. §32.a PERSISTED (observed, not assumed): `deploy-edge-functions` moved the `edge-live` tag to [`2286e3ec5c7bb4048ac04684346c01854454c17e`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/2286e3ec5c7bb4048ac04684346c01854454c17e); `paige-native-event-dispatch` (the sole orchestration-graph importer) redeployed with behaviorally-identical source; `edge-live..main` shows **zero edge drift** for the orchestration graph; **NO migration** in the diff → `db-live` correctly unmoved. Test proof: affected vitest **89/89** across the 5 Layer-C suites; the full suite adds **ZERO new failures** (the 4 red files are the pre-existing `src/solo/*` + `src/components/tenant-shell/*` baseline — zero `paige-orchestration` failures); tsc **14=14** (zero new, none in touched files); `outcomes.ts` strict-clean in isolation; new files lint-clean; the non-required `verify` red is that same proven pre-existing baseline. | **PROOF OWED (§13/§32.c): none new** — a contract lock with no tenant runtime surface.

The n8n workflow-runtime ActionAdapter (fire + POLL readback) as a reusable Layer-C adapter, driving the SAME fire/poll core `paige-n8n` drives — never a forked n8n client (owner directive, §18). NEW shared seam `_shared/n8n-run.ts` (the one home): `n8nFetch` (SSRF-guarded REST transport, moved verbatim), `resolveN8nConnection` (`get_tenant_n8n_secret` + instance-URL SSRF vet), and the `fireN8nWebhook`/`getN8nExecution` cores — each parameterized by an EXPLICIT tenant + a service-role client, resolving creds internally so the API key never leaves the seam. Why a shared seam and not `functions.invoke`: `paige-n8n` is JWT-tenant-gated and the headless Layer-C engine holds a service-role client + no JWT (it would 401). `paige-n8n` refactored to the seam, PROVEN byte-equivalent (§58) by the live-handler smokes (`smoke:n8n-ssrf` 33/33, `smoke:n8n-egress` 39/39). NEW `_shared/paige-orchestration/n8n-adapter.ts` wired into `adapters.ts`: ASYNC (n8n has no completion callback → poll is the only readback). dispatch fires → `accepted_for_execution` + the execution id (NEVER `executed` on a bare 2xx; refusal/non-2xx → terminal `failed`); readback polls → success → `executed`, node error → `failed`, in-flight/unbindable/not-found/infra → `ambiguous` (never a blind re-fire). Correlation stamped into the payload (spoof-safe); binds the poll by execution id (→ provider_ref). §39: one PLAUSIBLE finding (the `run` case handled only 4 of 7 refusal codes) fixed with a catch-all restoring parity with `execution_get`. | **Merged and PERSISTED; NO customer-facing behavior in the auto path.** The HIGH-risk hold is UNCHANGED and TRIPLE-guarded (governed clamp auto→confirm→approval_pending; execute-plan native-only engine.ts:304; phase-5 native-only engine.ts:521) — an unattended auto-lane n8n act HOLDS for approval and never dispatches; NO engine change.

Repaired the consequential-action confirm gate in `paige-ai-chat` + the pure `_shared/confirm-fingerprint.ts`: (A) a BATCH of same-tool confirmations is disambiguated by the stable subject id (`action_advance.action_id`, via the frozen `CONFIRM_IDENTITY_KEY`/`confirmIdentityValue`) WITHIN the operator's already-approved fingerprint set — narrows, never widens what is claimable; the STORED approved args execute. (B) an un-pinnable/ambiguous approval ends in ONE truthful terminal ("Action execution is temporarily unavailable; nothing changed or sent." + correlation id) that records nothing and cannot loop or execute. (C) `improvement_propose` returns an honest "nothing was filed" for a tenant-less/role-refused caller instead of throwing or faking a filing.

**2026-09-13 skill-runner routed through the canonical governed seam — §9 cross-tenant leak + spoofable authority closed (PR [#1179](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1179), squash-merged to `main` as `a52b194` from head `26bd6d2`, internal channel, Gate A; edge deployed via `deploy-edge-functions` run 292):**
The direct `skill-runner` Edge route now enforces the governed truth ITSELF instead of trusting an upstream caller
(Chat/MCP). `resolveSkillCaller` derives actor + tenant + approving authority SERVER-SIDE from the verified JWT (a
service-role caller is `principal:"service"`, which the seam refuses for this `high` mutation — a machine credential
is nobody's yes), never from `body.tenant_id`/`body.contact_id`/`body.invoker_kind`; `decideSkillRun` routes through
the shared `decideGovernedExecution` (§18 — the `skill` door mirrors the `mcp` door; a refusal writes no run row and
no side effect, audited only). Every subject lookup (`draft_and_email_document`, `build_game_plan`,
`verify_business_sos`, interpreter path) is scoped `.eq("tenant_id", callerTenantId)`, so a cross-tenant id resolves
to nothing rather than leaking tenant B under tenant B's identity. The one external send (`draft_and_email_document`)
is bound to a durable, single-use, fingerprint-bound approval in the EXISTING `paige_pending_confirmations` table
(fingerprint over action+tenant+contact+recipient+sender+doc_type+content SHA-256; atomic compare-and-set claim
excluding the minting request), and a failed send is reported honestly (`send_failed` → 502, never "succeeded"). No
migration, no new deps. Two INDEPENDENT reviewers (§39 adversarial + §5 compliance) read the real pushed diff; their
one converged §13 finding (failed-send-reported-as-success) was folded before merge. Proof: matrix 19/19 + reused-seam
142/142 + four governance lints, run locally; edge-deploy pipeline green on `a52b194`. **KNOWN LIMITATION (§32/§70):**
the authenticated runtime live-drive of the deployed function (the JWT→tenant derivation lives in Deno, not
unit-testable headless) is the owed proof class — owner/live-drive confirmation pending. LOW residuals (non-email-skill
governed-`propose` is honored via the pre-existing first-run confirm gate — the per-skill claim store is named
follow-up; `active_tenant_id` integrity is the platform pattern; any authenticated tenant member may run skills — a
§51 access decision) are pre-existing/disclosed, not regressions. **Post-merge hardening (PR [#1183](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1183)):** a THIRD independent reviewer (Codex, on the merged head) flagged two §13 receipt-honesty gaps in `recordReceipt` that the §39/§5 passes missed — (P1) the `paige_skill_runs`/`communication_log` write results were unchecked, so a failed receipt write after a successful send still returned a clean `succeeded` (AGENTS.md L48-49); (P2) the receipt recorded the redemption `body.inputs` rather than the APPROVED claimed inputs, so an altered phase-2 redemption could misdescribe the sent message. Fixed forward in #1183: the receipt write is checked (a sent-but-unrecorded send returns `succeeded_unrecorded`, never a silent clean success), and the run row records the claimed `doc_type`/`contact_id`/`content_sha256`. Host-code hardening, validated by the deno edge-ratchet typecheck; the live-drive remains the owed runtime proof.

**2026-09-13 Controlled provider proof — EXECUTED (owner-authorized ≤$1.25):** the IMAGE proof is
**COMPLETE end-to-end** on production: one `fal-ai/nano-banana` image (est $0.039 ≤ $0.25 cap) →
governed submit → signed fal webhook → Storage copy (`paige-generated`) → library row with full
media metadata → ledger consume (300→296) → Rail receipt (`vibe_media_image/capability_succeeded`,
job-attempt correlation) → platform accrual $0.039. The VIDEO proof (veo3.1 Fast 6s, est $0.90 ≤
$1.00, approval-gated: submitted `blocked` → approved → dispatched) GENERATED at fal (charge
stands) but its artifact copy lapsed: the pre-patch webhook discarded fal's result payload and
re-fetched URLs that 405 post-completion — reconciled truthfully to `failed`, the 90 reserved
credits CONSUMED (submitted-failure settlement, no leak), receipt recorded. Five integration
defects found and fixed BY the live proof, all merged to main: the fal result endpoint form
(`/response` first), Veo 3.1's `duration` string enum (bare numbers 422), the sweeper's missing
`verify_jwt=false` (every cron tick 401'd at the gateway), the approve-path ladder reading the
pre-rename discriminant (every approval was budget-denied), and the webhook now using the verified
payload as the primary result source. **Spend truth:** platform-recorded $1.689 (image $0.039 +
the validation-rejected first video $0.75 + the generated video $0.90); likely fal-actual $0.939
(fal does not bill 422 validation rejections — the dashboard is the authority). Guardrails held
throughout: daily ceiling $2, platform guard $25, video flag+approval, credit hold-before-dispatch.

The owner's 2026-09-12 Command Center mandate releases the parked `operator.platform` seam. Ships the Phase 0 map

Phase 1's shell/guard already shipped — reuse map, collision map, §58 Team-Pulse displacement record, the ten
AGENTS.md capability-routing answers) and Phase 2's first view: **Analytics → Platform health**, porting the v3
pack's own drawing (`paige-ia.js` L268–L294 + L496–L508) with real reads behind every figure — latest-run ledger
from the `systems_check_snapshot` seam (react-query-shared with Systems Check), platform-health ledger rows
resolving from real registry checks (`operator_cross_tenant_canary`/`operator_rls_coverage`/
`operator_migration_drift`) plus run history and alert firings, sweep-outcome stackbars from
`paige_systems_check_run`, real `acknowledged_at` latency, and honest absences where no substrate exists
(LLM error rate names the missing metric series rather than drawing one). `FleetTeamPulseSurface` (a retired-pack
stopgap) displaced with its §58 record — kept on disk, owed to the Settings → Team port. Also repairs

moved in-change; brain index row + decision-log entry; UI evidence record

`ci:tsc` ratchet red from #1175 vocabulary vs the gateway test — verified pre-existing on clean main; `verify`
red on the same pre-existing set as the #1162 precedent). **Customer-release eligibility: No** — internal
Platform Operator surface, no tenant-visible change.

**2026-09-13 Capability Portfolio — the One Paige Operating Platform delivery standard (PR [#1175](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1175), squash-merged to `main` from head `43544cac`, internal channel, owner-approved Gate A):**
Makes the one-governed-platform model binding for every future agent on `main`. Master Reference §3 gains the
**Capability Portfolio rule** — one entry path (Gateway → tenant/actor/role/connection truth → authority/approval/
budget/policy → adapter or canonical write → readback → receipt + Rail → truthful explanation), a prohibition on
per-domain Harnesses/authority engines/registries/job systems/memories/orchestrators, and the **200-capability
portfolio recorded as owner-approved BINDING product direction** with two guardrails: "200" is never a
delivery-percentage or `LIVE`-coverage score, and runtime truth is never duplicated out of its owning record.
`docs/doctrine/paige-capability-portfolio.md` is the ONE owner-vision artifact — Part A the fifteen families and
intended outcomes (quoted from the ledger's own owner-approved `completion_criterion`, claiming **no runtime
availability**), Part B routing to the records that own status, Part C a **CI-verified** ledger mirror.
`AGENTS.md` gains a ten-question PRE-EDIT routing gate, scoped deliberately as pre-edit and deferring to the
existing six-part ship-time checklist in `docs/brain/paige-brain-wiring-standard.md` §3 so the two are one
lifecycle, not rival lists. Second Brain index + PR template carry the same routing with honest "not applicable"
required. **Enforcement added no new lint, npm script or workflow** — a CI survey found the requested checks
substantially covered, so `scripts/ci/binding-ledger-lint.mjs` was EXTENDED twice (§18): dead code-anchor
detection (clean on current `main`, blocks nothing today) and mirror parity (Part C must match the ledger or CI
fails, which is what stops a copy of a CI-enforced field becoming a second source of truth). The mirror guard's
first implementation reported GREEN on a corrupted mirror because its path was stale after a rename — the §32
false-green this standard exists to prevent — and now fails loudly on a missing file; proven four ways (clean ·
drifted state · omitted row · missing file). **Two owner rulings recorded in the same PR:** Registry Steward →
the **Harness workstream** (governance/consistency, never a build bottleneck; domains keep their adapters and
propose their own entries), and `ui-delivery-evidence` **to become a required status check**.
**Proof boundary (§13):** green — `lint:binding-ledger` + its 35-case self-test, `lint:integration-registry`,
`audit`, `Validate UI delivery evidence`, Vercel; all 12 relative links resolve. **`verify` is RED and it is NOT
this PR's** — `lint:views`, `lint:chat-tool-registry` and `Test` (10 failed files / 15 failed tests) reproduce
identically on clean `origin/main` with this diff absent, verified in a separate worktree; other lanes' baseline
debt, no fix existed to port, one standing-down comment posted and no re-run spent. **`ui-delivery-evidence`
remains ADVISORY** — branch protection is a repository setting, a headless session measured `403 Resource not
accessible by integration` on `GET /branches/main/protection`, so neither the change nor its read-back can be
made or claimed from here; owner action owed. **Customer-release eligibility: NO** — internal delivery
governance, no customer capability, no release record.

**2026-09-12 Vibe Media credits — LIVE (PR #1168 → main `f1645d4c`, plus fix-forwards `6e393930`/`5cd9a03e`):** the durable tenant-scoped Media Credit ledger (migration `20270123000000`, renumbered off the collided 20270122 slot) — append-only BY TRIGGER (UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE raise; service_role SELECT+INSERT only; RESTRICT parents), closure-model hold/consume/release with the anti-leakage gate (submitted jobs consume — fal already charged), lazy monthly included grant (300 credits = $3.00; 1 cr = $0.01) + all-prior-month lapse, the settlement companion, the ENFORCED platform spend guard inside hold under a global-class lock (`media_spend_ceiling_usd` $25 default — `media_provider_ceiling_usd` documented as the activation gate it always was), and the R22 owner-only `get_workspace_media_usage` billing read. Veo 3.1 correction (deprecated veo3 replaced; audio-on estimates). paige-media: platform guard + credit hold BEFORE any provider call; truthful 402 insufficient-credit. Billing: the Vibe Media card on the ONE surface (allowance/remaining/purchased/reserved-in-flight/50-80-100 notices/category breakdown/receipt trail/packs-as-roadmap) + the presentation contract + Vibe rail credit line. 12 contract + 12 seam tests + the 22-assertion pgTAP suite in CI's database-contract job (which caught and fixed: the jsonb setting reads, the missing authenticated grant, the grant-RPC split inconsistency). The authorized controlled proof ran against production: the FULL governed ladder proven live (authorization → workspace-scoped job → budget ladder → 300-credit lazy mint → hold 4 credits → truthful provider failure → anti-leakage release → credits restored → platform spend $0 → Rail receipt), plus two real bugs found-and-fixed by the live probe (capabilities read on the wrong client; the RPC 42702 alias collision — fix-forward `20270124000000`). **BLOCKED at the provider boundary: fal rejects the FAL_KEY credential (403) — the secret exists by name but is invalid/expired/malformed; zero provider spend occurred. The owner re-issues the fal key (id:secret form) as the FAL_KEY secret and the paid proof resumes.** No Stripe products, no charge path, no customer activation.

**2026-09-12 Social Operations Phase 0 + canonical tenant-safe foundation — deployed containment/foundation,
Social operations UNAVAILABLE (PR #1162, main `d71fa70f19dda13f3b8f8dc9d968bc9cbbcdbf65`, production):**
The approved Solo Social destination now tells one conservative story across Campaigns, Settings, Admin,
Agency, Vibe entry points, and Chat: declared public handles remain capture-only (`PARTIAL`, authenticated proof
owed); provider connection, durable operational drafts, publishing, scheduling, provider analytics, and
recommendations are `UNAVAILABLE`. Chat no longer advertises or dispatches `social_post`, `social_accounts`, or
`social_analytics`; `social_post` is hard-off in the canonical autonomy resolver. The five legacy Social Edge
Functions share one `_shared/socialUnavailable.ts` response and terminate before request-body, credential,
database, or provider access. This supersedes #1164's narrower publication-only module and its preserved-read
claim; no second containment contract remains.

Migration `20270122000000_social_foundation_tenant_recovery.sql` is applied and persisted. Production had the
tenant-shaped, zero-row 20270117 predecessor, now preserved at
`private.paige_social_posts_legacy_20270117`; the operator-only archive is correctly absent and no ownership was
inferred. The canonical public model has tenant-bound accounts, draft roots, immutable versions, account
targets, approval/confirmation-bound jobs, provider results, idempotency, and stable provider correlation.
All six tables have forced RLS; authenticated users have tenant-resolved read-only access to posts, versions,
targets, and jobs; raw account/token-reference and provider-result tables are service-only. Production counts
at closeout were zero in the archive and all six canonical tables. Exact-head `database-contract` passed full
fresh replay through later migrations plus legacy-operator and tenant-shaped double-application/rollback
rehearsals; required audit, contract, lint, UI-evidence, Deno, TypeScript ratchet, changed-source ESLint, and
build gates passed. The non-required full `verify` failed only the exact same two guards and 18 tests / 3 files
as current base `a451278e`.

Deployment evidence: migration workflow run
[`34724523564`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/actions/runs/34724523564) and Edge workflow run
[`34724523591`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/actions/runs/34724523591) succeeded; both
production domains returned build `d71fa70f19dda13f3b8f8dc9d968bc9cbbcdbf65-mtyzv35r`; GitHub/Vercel
production deployment `6415387221` resolved to `https://paige-agent-r7oad1erh-paige-agent-ai.vercel.app`.
Credential-free
endpoint probes returned canonical 503 `attempted:false` where anonymous invocation is permitted and 401 at
the JWT gateway otherwise. Exact hosted type generation is `PROOF OWED`: the available Supabase account token
lacks the generated-types endpoint privilege and this Windows host has no supported container runtime; the
committed six-table/two-RPC Social blocks were directly compared with the deployed 93-column catalog. The
authenticated rendered Solo drive is also `UNVERIFIED` after the managed browser runtime failed at its Windows
ACL boundary before navigation. No provider or credential was invoked. **Next material owner gate:** choose one
Beta provider/platform and authorize its OAuth app ownership, scopes, redirect domains, test account,
credentials, and bounded real-publication proof. **Customer-release eligibility:** none; this is an internal
safety and database-health foundation, not a live Social capability. Authority/evidence:

**2026-09-12 Solo Calendar — owner RESCHEDULE + EDIT wired to the live governed booking engine (PR #1176, squash-merged to `main` as `4fdf471505e9f496495d359369a63f7537eec411`, owner-approved Gate A) — ✅ SHIPPED + MIGRATION PERSISTED:** §32 persisted-apply proof — the `deploy-migrations` pipeline ran on the merge commit and moved the `db-live` tag to `4fdf471`; `20270125000000_calendar_update_internal_booking.sql` is present in the `db-live` tree and `git diff db-live..origin/main -- supabase/migrations` is empty (zero drift), so the `update_internal_booking` RPC and the §59-hardened `reschedule`/`cancel` guards are live on prod. **STILL PROOF OWED (§32.c/§70):** the authenticated owner behavioral drive on the live Solo Calendar (create/edit/reschedule/cancel, tenant isolation, persisted readback, honest failure/retry) is owed to a browser-capable session — Calendar is NOT declared complete on structural + migration proof alone.
Closes the genuine remaining gap in the *mounted* Solo Calendar. **§18/§30 correction (see §10):** the brief targeted `src/solo/calendar-data.tsx`/`calendar.tsx` as "a fixture with no write scope," but that surface is **dead, orphaned, and contract-test-blocked** — `SoloApp.tsx:266` mounts `TenantCanonicalCalendarWorkspace → SoloCalendarWorkspace` backed by the real `useSoloCalendar` hook, already wired to the deployed native booking engine (`calendars`, `internal_bookings`, `list_team_bookings`, `create_internal_booking`, `admin_set_booking_status`, realtime, real overlap conflicts, honest empty/loading/stale states). Owner could create, cancel/status-change, and see real tenant-scoped events — but could **not reschedule or edit**. This wires both. **Reschedule (move):** `useSoloCalendar.reschedule()` + a `RescheduleDrawer` (mirrors `CreateDrawer`, existing `sc-*` design system — §00 port-only) call the **already-deployed** `reschedule_internal_booking` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER, §59-guarded: booking's tenant + admin/coach/host; `BOOKING_BAD_TIME`); the DB GiST EXCLUDE `internal_bookings_no_overlap` refuses a clash (23P01), and the UPDATE **auto-emits the `booking.rescheduled` governed Layer-C signal** to `paige_client_events` via the existing `emit_booking_rail` trigger — no migration, live on frontend deploy. **Edit (details):** new migration `20270125000000_calendar_update_internal_booking.sql` adds `update_internal_booking(_booking_id,_title,_guest_name,_notes,_calendar_id,_tenant_id)` — §59 in-body caller scope (host, platform operator, or an active owner/admin/coach member OF THE BOOKING'S OWN TENANT), validates a moved-to calendar belongs to the booking's own tenant (mirrors create), touches **title/guest/notes/calendar ONLY** (never start/end/status, so the emit trigger fires **no** false `booking.rescheduled`/`booking.cancelled` — verified against the trigger body), grant `authenticated`+`service_role` (anon revoked → `lint:definer-fns` clean). `EditDrawer` + `useSoloCalendar.edit()` wire it. **§59 family hardening (Codex §39 review, §58 explicit call-out):** the same migration `CREATE OR REPLACE`s `reschedule_internal_booking` and `cancel_internal_booking` to close the identical global-role trap they carried — `has_any_role(...)` on the tenant-agnostic `user_roles` let a global admin/coach from another tenant act on this tenant's booking. Replaced with the tenant-scoped `tenant_members` membership check on the row's tenant. §37 producer inventory verified reschedule's only runtime caller is this PR's own UI, cancel has none, update is new — no legitimate caller regressed (§58). Both reuse the tenant-gated-RPC pattern (never a raw client UPDATE, which RLS would no-op-with-false-success, §13); errors map through one honest `bookingWriteMessage` helper (overlap/forbidden/not-found/bad-time → plain sentences, unknown → verbatim). Reschedule/Edit are withheld on an off-schedule (cancelled/no-show) booking; **Reschedule is additionally withheld on a class session** (a single-row move would orphan its seats — Codex §39 P1; Edit stays, it never moves time); the shared 22023 SQLSTATE is split by the guard's message prefix so an edit never mislabels a missing-title/dropped-calendar failure as "that time could not be used" (Codex §39 P2); the detail-drawer foot wraps (`flex-wrap`, no unreachable control). **Proven (§13/§32, evidence separated):** *automated* — 130/130 tenant-calendar tests (9 new: reschedule move+preserve-length, reschedule refusal, off-schedule disable, class-session reschedule withheld, edit carry-values, empty-title guard, edit refusal, `bookingWriteMessage` unit + its 22023-prefix split) + the existing contract test that keeps the fixture de-mounted; *static* — `typecheck` adds **0** errors (pre-existing errors on `main`, none in touched files — the tsc ratchet confirms zero new beyond baseline), `eslint` clean on touched files, `vite build` green, `migration-lint` + `lint:definer-fns` + `migration-version-collision-lint` green; *fresh-replay* — the `PAIGE Spine contract`/`database-contract` CI job is green on the current head. **PROOF OWED (§32/§70):** the migration's BEGIN..ROLLBACK SQL proof is owed to CI `premerge-migration-proof` and its persisted apply to `deploy-migrations` (Supabase MCP was denied all session — no local prod verify); the authenticated owner live-drive of reschedule + edit (§32.c) is owed to a browser-capable session (this headless session has no browser/prod reach). **Deploy reality:** reschedule goes live on the frontend (Vercel) merge (RPC already deployed); edit is live once `deploy-migrations` applies `20270125000000` (a brief pre-apply window would surface the honest "function not found" message via `bookingWriteMessage`, never a crash; reschedule is unaffected). **Customer-release eligibility:** none — internal build; owner reviews on the live site per §4 pre-launch.

Denies Social PUBLICATION at both content-publication seams — `paige-social` `post` (Upload-Post) and

`UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY`/`META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` cannot flip the denial (§13/§38 — "connected/configured ≠

to a prose mention, so the main commit `19ccb133699837d745c053769070ca7a3659f06f` does NOT carry it as a
functional trailer (`git interpret-trailers --parse` shows only Co-Authored-By/Claude-Session). That is
expected — `ui-delivery-evidence` is a PR-time gate (it was satisfied on #1164), and the evidence record
itself is on main; the trailer has no post-merge function. Edge deploy: `paige-social` + `meta-schedule-post`
redeploy via `deploy-edge-functions.yml` (run #282 on `19ccb13`). **OWNER RULING (2026-09-12): this is INTERIM
containment, NOT the canonical Social implementation.** Codex PR #1162 (Social Operations Gate A — containment +
canonical foundation) is canonical; on its rebase onto fresh main it MUST preserve/strengthen every denial here
(no silent re-enable of `social_post`, Upload-Post, Meta publishing, false receipts, or any alternate
publication seam) and resolve the `paige-social/index.ts` overlap once, retaining the stronger canonical impl —
never two permanent containment modules. **PROOF OWED (§32.c):** the authenticated "Paige refuses to publish"
live drive is owed to a browser-capable session (this headless session cannot drive the authed app); the denial
is a unit+structure-proven backend fact. Evidence: `docs/evidence/ui-delivery/social-publish-containment.md`.
**Customer-release eligibility:** none — internal safeguard; Social publishing stays UNAVAILABLE by design; no
customer-facing capability added.

**2026-09-12 Harness Layer G — proof-lane authenticated-proof framework (PR #1163, owner-approved Gate A):**
Shipped `scripts/live-drive/proof-lane.mjs` — a reusable framework that turns an authenticated governed
flow into data + a runner (extends `live-drive.mjs`, no fork). Honest by construction (§13/§32): reports
`VERIFIED` only when a real authenticated drive asserts, `PROOF_OWED` (no browser launched) otherwise, and
fails the flow when a negative/guard step's action unexpectedly succeeds. Proof-status vocabulary, negative
step kinds (denied/approval/unavailable-connection/provider-failure/retry/cancelled/account-switch),
build+tenant+actor+timestamp attribution, secret-redaction; 7 concrete governed-flow definitions. Proven:
`test:proof-lane` 22/22 (CI, browser-free) + real-Chromium mechanics proof (sandbox). **Authenticated
runtime is PROOF_OWED** across all 7 flows until a capable session has the least-privilege Solo test tenant
+ `LIVE_DRIVE_*` CI secrets (owner-approved; this session cannot provision/set-secrets/reach-prod). This is
the Layer-G verification backbone that lets a binding-ledger surface move `PROOF_OWED → LIVE` once driven.

**2026-09-12 Vibe Studio governed media seam (fal.ai) — LIVE as deployed code, config-gated OFF (PR #1153, main `d5387376`):** one durable media layer per the owner build authorization + MVP-mode standing order, merged after the #1159 replay bridge let the exact-head database-contract validate migration `20270121000000` (renamed from 20270118 after the Chat collision). Deployed: `paige-media` (governed front door — server-derived tenant, shared budget ladder with fail-closed media deviations, video flag + daily cap + always-approval, music truthful 403), `paige-media-webhook` (verify_jwt=false in config.toml + manual `--no-verify-jwt` deploy after a config-only push didn't trigger the pipeline; unsigned prod probe returns the function's OWN `{"error":"unverified"}` — the ED25519 JWKS fail-closed path is live), `paige-media-sweeper` (*/2 cron, verified on prod). §32 persisted-apply CONFIRMED by read-only prod queries: schema_migrations row, paige_media_jobs + 5 policies, claim RPC, cron job, realtime publication. Post-deploy probes: no-auth paige-media/sweeper 401 at the JWT wall; webhook reaches the in-function verifier only. Adversarial diff pass fixed 3 blockers incl. deleting a stale-baseline save_marketing_content replacement that would have regressed the tenant gate; 16 security-contract tests pin the webhook/bypass proofs. **PROOF OWED (owner-gated):** controlled first paid generation — FAL_KEY + media_provider_ceiling_usd + media_budget_daily_usd + explicit max test spend are the owner's fail-closed go-live switches; authenticated UI drive (no test credentials in build sessions). Capability truth: media generation UNAVAILABLE by config until then; music UNAVAILABLE; Social publishing non-executable. Evidence: docs/evidence/ui-delivery/vibe-media-fal.md.

**2026-09-12 Harness Completion Program — Map + P1 fresh-replay compatibility bridge (PR #1159, owner-approved Gate A):**
Shipped `docs/delivery/harness-completion-map.md` — the owner's required first deliverable: a read-only
A–G-layer navigation synthesis over the canonical records (grounded by a 5-agent crew against `main 6aa077d`),
naming the keystone (the native-event dispatcher delivers but executes no acts; RE-2 execution lane dark) and
a phased Gate-A program sequenced around the in-flight #1157 Layer-A/B kernel. **P1 = the #1155 fresh-replay
repair:** guarded `20270117000000`'s `paige_social_posts` `tenant_id` index/policies on the column existing,
restoring a truthful from-zero `database-contract` replay (FAILURE→SUCCESS on the fix) so every
migration-bearing workstream can test/merge/deploy again. **This is an explicit COMPATIBILITY BRIDGE, not the
final canonical Social schema:** it preserves the live operator-scoped `paige_social_posts` behavior exactly,
fabricates no tenant ownership, touches no legacy rows, and establishes **no** tenant-safe Social publishing/
scheduling/analytics. **Known limitation (gap, §5):** the operator-vs-tenant `paige_social_posts` schema
conflict leaves two Solo Social surfaces wired but non-functional on prod — tracked in **#1161**, to be
replaced by the complete Social Foundation migration. Merging also unblocks the backed-up prod migration queue
(20270117→latest; all additive) — persisted-apply self-verified by the `deploy-migrations` pipeline.
**2026-09-10 durable-job first-adopter deployment + live verification:** migration `20270106000000`
was applied to production with history parity (top of `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`) and
`weekly-summary-cron` was deployed at version 801 post-#1084-merge (crew pipeline). Live verification
against production on 2026-09-10, all rollback-isolated with zero persistent test state: **(1)**
concurrent claim atomicity — session A claimed a synthetic due row (1) while session B's simultaneous
`claim_due_weekly_summaries` returned 0 (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED held); **(2)** lease/re-claim
exclusion — a second claim during the live lease returned 0; **(3)** attempts ceiling — claim at
attempts=4 succeeded (→5), claim at ceiling returned 0, and `mark_exhausted_weekly_summaries`
stamped `failed/attempt_ceiling_reached`; **(4)** end-to-end — the deployed function's response is
the retrofit shape (`{"success":true,"claimed":0,"dispatched":0}`; the pre-retrofit shape lacked
`claimed`). The #1084 row's "deploy + authenticated runtime proof" next gate is therefore closed
for claim semantics. Still `PROOF OWED`: a Rail receipt from a real send via
`record_capability_run` (requires a real opted-in user and a genuine tick — synthetic testing cannot
produce it honestly) and volume behavior with real due rows.

**2026-09-08 chat-scroll acceptance correction:** the #1057 entry below remains a historical
shipping/owner-acceptance record, not current behavioral acceptance. The owner has since reproduced
delayed reading-position theft after #1066. The shared scroll workstream is REOPENED P0 / FAIL,
with no verified last-known-good build for indefinite manual ownership. The existing
[forensic closeout](evidence/ui-delivery/paige-chat-scroll-forensic-regression-correction.md) owns
the corrective evidence. #1075 reached production as `f86b1c401c492c4d0dc122258b6c26b96870befe`, but the owner reports the reset persists. Same-parent portal reinsertion is now reproduced and under narrow correction; acceptance remains FAIL. Other agents continue undisturbed.

This is the **sole chronological log of deliveries to `main`**. It records every merged PR, including documentation/governance-only merges, because repository truth also ships. A row proves that the named commit reached `main`; it does not by itself prove migration apply, Edge/Fly/Vercel deployment, authenticated behavior, owner acceptance, or customer communication. Those are stated separately and linked to their canonical evidence.

**Maintenance rule:** append one row after every merge to `main`, oldest to newest. Record the exact PR and main commit, what shipped and why, the honest delivery/proof boundary, the next real gate, and customer-release eligibility. Never create a second shipped log. A closeout-only PR whose sole change is recording the preceding delivery's exact post-merge identity closes that preceding row and is not logged recursively; Git is the evidence for that mechanical closeout commit. The exception may not carry product, policy, capability, or status change.

**Backfill cutoff:** Git blame and first-parent history identify the prior final Section 4 addition as [PR #1029](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/pull/1029), [`1fee541808b71293329e8111f45b17cd28248794`](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/commit/1fee541808b71293329e8111f45b17cd28248794), on 2026-09-06 at 19:43 EDT: Integration Capability Registry v1.1 / API Expense & Operations. The initial backfill covers all 18 first-parent `main` deliveries through `53104500`; subsequent rows continue the same log.

**Customer-release boundary for this backfill:** no canonical record exists under `docs/release-governance/records/`. Every row is therefore **not currently eligible** for a customer-facing release note, name, version, or announcement. This does not diminish internal delivery; it prevents internal work from becoming an unsupported public promise.

#### Affected-flow and collision assessment

- **Owner job:** find one dependable answer to what reached `main`, why it shipped, what proof exists, and what is still owed.
- **Flow:** future agents read this Section 4.0 at startup and PR preparation; after merge they append the exact evidence-backed row and update the relevant detailed authority instead of creating another tracker.
- **Canonical ownership:** this Master Reference remains the only master project document and Section 4.0 is the only chronological shipped log. The Integration Capability Registry, Surface Binding Ledger, release policy/schema, evidence records, delivery records, and Second Brain retain their narrower facts and are linked rather than copied.
- **Active collisions:** PR #754 overlaps the Master/Second Brain maintenance language and must rebase after this reconciliation. PRs #1040, #905, #917, #729, #907, #899, #724, #648, and #560 touch one or both index files in other sections and must preserve this section when rebased. Historical PRs #12/#11 touch `src/App.tsx`, #10 touches the retired landing component, and #560 touches the separately retained prototype route; this work owns the current canonical route correction.

#### Production-version and duplication audit — 2026-09-08 01:22 EDT

| Category | Verified finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Stale deployed version | **None found after remediation and current-main refresh.** `paigeagent.ai/version.json` and `app.paigeagent.ai/version.json` both return build `87a3a41d188c93b7073816e352f3c7604548f7a6-mts7zmtk` with `customerUpdate: null`. Vercel production deployment `dpl_95h8jrhA9VZ8wE7auvVCX3aH5yPR` is `READY` from exact canonical `main` SHA `87a3a41d188c93b7073816e352f3c7604548f7a6` and aliases both domains. This is #1060's product delivery; its ancestry includes the route, Live Conversation, Runtime Harness, and chat-scroll deliveries already recorded below. | Current production and canonical `main` match. No manual promotion or rollback was needed. Public `track-event` requests emitted CORS/401 console errors on both domains during route proof; route behavior was unaffected, but telemetry ownership requires separate diagnosis. |
| Documentation duplication | The separate `docs/delivery/PAIGE-DELIVERY-LEDGER.md` draft would have competed with this section. `docs/doctrine/canonical-build-order.md` is an owner-locked sequencing roadmap, `docs/delivery/PAIGE-CHAT-DELIVERY-MAP.md` is a bounded chat audit, `docs/DONE.md` is a historical archive, and the release/binding/integration records own narrower facts; none is a second shipped log. | Separate ledger draft removed. Master and Second Brain point only here. Specialized canonical records retained. |
| Obsolete source code | Base `main` still compiled two prior public-home implementations, `Index` at `/legacy` and `PremiumHero` at `/premium`, even though the canonical architecture called both unlinked and outside the intended surface. | Narrow correction in this work: both paths replace-redirect to `/`; both obsolete page components are removed; a route contract test prevents re-mounting. |
| Active route/component duplication | `/tenant-redesign` remains a reachable, explicitly documented representative front-end prototype with no production authority. It is not presented as the canonical tenant shell, but it is still an active review route. | Retained. Its extensive approved handoff/evidence record means obsolescence cannot be inferred; retirement or development-only gating requires a separate owner decision. |
| Active tenant-shell duplication | Production eligibility now resolves to 4 active top-level standalone Solo tenants; all 4 have `features.solo_shell_enabled=true`, so 0 eligible tenant is served the legacy shell. The older 7/4/3 count is historical rollout evidence, not current platform truth. | No production-data mutation was needed. The current count rules out an active legacy-shell population, but authenticated cross-tenant behavior remains a separate proof class. |
| Harmless historical artifact | Vercel still returns a historical `/assets/SoloApp-CQ9-3o2z.js` object with HTTP 200, but neither current production HTML nor the current initial bundle references that filename. `OperatorLegacyApp` is retained in source but is explicitly unmounted. Compatibility paths such as `/dashboard` redirect to their canonical home. | Retained as unreferenced provider/source history. An addressable old asset is not a served platform version; no deletion was attempted. |
| Duplicate capability contract or registry | No competing Integration Capability Registry, Surface Binding Ledger, release record store, or second Master Reference was found. Their schemas and CI guards identify one canonical home each. | No product or registry deletion. Continue linking their detailed facts from each shipped row. |

**Current backend delivery identity at this audit:** production carries 1,000 migrations, latest `20270105000000_campaign_brief_verified_rail_copy`, and 225 active Edge functions. PR #1053's `20260907155052_paige_live_conversation_control_plane` migration is applied; `paige-live-session` v2, `paige-tts` v28, and `paige-voice-profile-admin` v2 are active with JWT verification. Other relevant versions include `paige-ai-chat` v209, `business-mission-action` v2, `export-document` v1, and `browser-use` v1. These counts prove deployed inventory only; they do not upgrade authenticated capability proof.

### Paige OS Integration — the Surface Binding Ledger + the Surface Context Handoff Contract (2026-09-06, Phases 0–1)

**What shipped: two durable contracts + one CI regression guard. NO runtime binding was created and no
surface changed behaviour.** This is the program's foundation — the single source of truth for how
every Solo surface binds to Paige, and the release rule that keeps that truth honest.

- **Phase 0 — the Surface Binding Ledger** (`docs/binding-ledger/surface-binding-ledger.json` +
  `README.md`). One machine-readable + human-readable ledger of every meaningful Solo surface (25 rows,
  plus the intentionally-separate operator console recorded out-of-scope = 26 rows) across the full
  chain — *source → server-resolved tenant scope → safe context → authority → governed write →
  verified outcome → Rail → Mind → Memory* — using the six states LIVE / PARTIAL / READ_ONLY_CONTEXT /
  INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED / UNAVAILABLE / PROOF_OWED. It is the **unifying index** that CITES the Mind
  integration matrix, the Spine/Rail state doc, the surface cards and the parity matrix — it forks
  none of them. **Enforced by `scripts/ci/binding-ledger-lint.mjs` (`lint:binding-ledger`, wired into
  `ci.yml`)**: a surface cannot be reported LIVE / "Paige-connected" without a complete entry proven by
  `authenticated_runtime` — a rendered page, a badge, a prototype or an "Open Paige" button never
  satisfies a binding link (§13/§32). Guard self-test 13/13; runs clean on all 26 rows.
- **Phase 1 — the Surface Context Handoff Contract** (`docs/doctrine/surface-context-handoff-contract.md`).
  The one server-safe way a surface opens the dedicated Paige workspace: the client sends an
  **allowlisted INTENT** (surface + public-safe record ref + enumerated ask), never raw page payload,
  tenant id, role, secrets or a forged snapshot; the server resolves the safe context via the JWT
  tenant resolution + the registered Spine capabilities already wired into `paige-ai-chat`; fail-closed
  on workspace switch / role change / deleted record / stale source / denied actor; reuses the
  `paige_pending_confirmations` approval gate (no second approval system) and EXTENDS `paigeClientScope`
  (§18). It names the three gaps it closes: the raw `clientContext` prose payload, the silently-dropped
  prompt (#771), and the missing surface identity.

**Honest state (never imply live from a doc):** the ledger and contract are **published**; the Phase 1
runtime adoption (extending the scope bridge, consuming the intent, retiring the raw prose, the two
regression guards) is **DEFERRED to the next bounded slice** with coordination, because it touches
owned surfaces and contested files. Across the platform, **no surface is LIVE** — Mind axis-B is NO
everywhere; of the 26 rows (25 Solo surfaces + the operator console recorded out-of-scope), **4 are
PROOF_OWED** (read-context wired + tested, authenticated runtime owed), **5 PARTIAL** (including
Command Center → Business Game Plan, whose Business Mission governed write is wired + chat-bound via
#983), **2 INTENTIONALLY_ISOLATED**, and **15 UNAVAILABLE**. **Scope: Solo only**; the operator tree
is recorded out-of-scope (no subaccount/operator binding without explicit release). **Next owning
workstream:** the Phase 1 adoption slice (reads `surface-context-handoff-contract.md` first), then the
Spine SCR-1/2/3 sequence for the UNAVAILABLE surfaces. Second Brain updated: `docs/brain/README.md`
(architecture + doctrine indexes). §00: the ledger holds zero design opinion; the "IN CONTEXT" banner
and truthful-status components are Claude Design's.

**UPDATE (2026-09-06) — two subsequent owner rulings on the ledger (supersede the "13/13" guard count above):**
1. **Intended Operating Capability dimension (#1000, merged `5796323`).** Every surface gained a second
   dimension `intended_capability` — the product operating TARGET across five authority lanes (read ·
   draft · auto · confirm · prohibited) + a real-action `completion_criterion` — mapped to §16/§67,
   separate from `state` (current proof). An absent proof never shrinks the target.
2. **Standing Delegated Authority (owner ruling 2026-09-06, §58 correction).** Paige is a real operating
   agent: with owner/authorized-rep authority she executes consequential actions (payments, bookkeeping,
   purchases, ad-spend, defined team-role changes, client ops, connected-tool work) autonomously **within
   a bounded standing policy** (scope + caps + window + provider authority + stop conditions + audit) —
   `confirm` is an escalation lane, not a ban. This REVERSED #1000's `auto: "None"` framing on the
   consequential surfaces and NARROWED `owner_only` to only the genuinely non-delegable (ownership
   transfer; platform-level/break-glass authority; changing the authority policy beyond the grantor's
   authority; moving/holding money outside a valid connected-provider+scope+policy per §38; law/provider/
   security/explicit-owner prohibition). 15 surfaces marked `consequential: true`; a new
   `binding-ledger-lint` tripwire blocks a bare-`None` regression. The contract lives in
   `docs/doctrine/autonomy-architecture.md` §10 (§67.2). **Honest runtime truth (§13/§32, corrected 2026-09-06):** high-impact
   acts still clamp `auto`→`confirm` at runtime today. The standing-policy substrate (RE-1 —
   `paige_automations` + `resolve_automation_autonomy`, `20261022000000`/`20261024000000`) is **live on
   prod and wired into `paige-ai-chat`** (an earlier draft wrongly said it wasn't — §13 correction, see
   decision-log). The reason a `high` act clamps is the per-act **floor** (`paige_action_kinds` CHECK +
   `resolve_tool_autonomy`), not a missing substrate. The remaining build is **RE-2** — lifting that
   consequential-act floor under a valid standing policy (+ RE-1's owed idempotency/velocity additions,
   RE-3 controls/audit) — sequenced as the next PR, not shipped in this docs change. **Current guard:** self-test 33 cases; runs clean on all 26 rows. Every surface `state`
   unchanged by the correction (target changed, not proof). §66: no tier gating changed.

**UPDATE (owner ruling, 2026-09-06) — the ledger now carries a SECOND dimension so absent proof cannot
shrink the target.** Alongside `state` (what is PROVEN today), every surface declares
`intended_capability`: the product operating TARGET across five authority lanes — `read` · `draft` ·
`auto` (🟢 execute within tenant policy) · `confirm` (🟡 owner-confirmed) · `prohibited` (🔴 isolated) —
mapped to §16/§67, plus a `completion_criterion` naming the REAL action/outcome that proves the surface
done (never "open" or "summarize"). The CI guard now requires the block on every surface and fails a
passive completion_criterion. Paige is built to help RUN the company through governed actions; the ledger
describes the gap to that target, it does not narrow the target to what is built today. **The next
runtime slice — Business Game Plan + Missions — must demonstrate a real governed Paige action (create/
revise/sequence/advance a Business Mission) with a verified outcome and Rail evidence, not a richer
context handoff.**

### Solo Tenant Brain — Business Mission vertical slice deployed PARTIAL (2026-09-06)

- PR #1016 is squash-merged and deployed at `68d7c10f4381dd66a5d930d82f9400d004d189b5`. `deploy-migrations` run 34057655392 and `deploy-edge-functions` run 34057655408 passed; both live markers moved to that SHA at the #1016 closeout. Current main includes later M1-a #1014, so `edge-live` remains `68d7c10f` while `db-live` is the descendant `94e08d8b` containing the Mission migration. Closeout PR #1018 deployed web/docs SHA `19fc0270`.
- Paige now resolves the selected Mission from the persisted chat thread under the caller's server-resolved active Solo tenant, supplies bounded source/revision/lifecycle/freshness context before reasoning, uses the existing approval-gated Mission RPCs, and verifies every normalized canonical persisted field before calling the existing Rail writer. Mission request UUID is the stable Rail run identity.
- This is `PARTIAL`, not Tenant Brain completion. Authenticated production Solo-owner, denied-role, cross-tenant, canonical Mission-row and matching Rail-row/read-projection proof remain `PROOF OWED`. Mission Mind and durable Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`; no external business action or outcome is implied by a Mission record change.
- Integration Capability Registry #1019 explicitly excludes pure Supabase/Vercel/GitHub delivery infrastructure from tenant-capability provider entries and governs it through `config-registry.md` (§18). This slice created no customer provider capability, connection scope or external authority, so it correctly does not add a duplicate provider entry. Any later provider-facing Tenant Brain lane must update its actual registry entry in the same delivery.
### Business Vault Phase 2 owner/admin foundation — deployed PARTIAL at `809faec3` (2026-09-06)

- 🟡 **PARTIAL / DEPLOYED.** Tenant-bound owner/admin Vault navigation, Overview, Library metadata, Contracts, Obligations, focused record inspector, archive/fact-revocation lifecycle, and truthful member denial shipped in PR #986 merge `809faec3`. Server functions resolve the active workspace and current role; client-supplied tenant or authority values are never trusted. Authenticated production behavior is not yet proven.
- ✅ Owner-only records, dependent contract/obligation metadata, downloads, and fact review remain invisible and immutable to tenant administrators. Known-ID, cross-tenant, workspace-switch, demotion, stale-fact, replacement, and duplicate races have executable actor/database coverage.
- 🟣 Binary PDF/image intake is intentionally **UNAVAILABLE**. The private quarantine, inspection evidence, bounded cleanup, and disabled-promotion contract exists, but the repository has no approved OCR/DLP adapter or proven byte-copy worker. No uninspected file can become a normal Vault record, download, Paige/Mind context, shared artifact, task, Rail outcome, or external action.
- ✅ **Automated/static/CI proof:** 29 focused tests, 71 count-enforced actor/RLS assertions, two-session duplicate/cleanup proof, affected lint, Deno/type ratchets, production build, audit/contracts/database/UI evidence, complete CI rerun, and three independent reviews PASS.
- ✅ **Production deployment proof:** post-merge CI passed; `db-live` and `edge-live` both point to `809faec3`; Vercel Production deployment `6MT79LnaSVWixnZXWQwStnVsNW2F` succeeded for that SHA; `paigeagent.ai` and `app.paigeagent.ai` returned HTTP 200 with live Solo chunk `SoloApp-GsPt1vrB.js` carrying the fail-closed Vault fingerprints.
- 🟡 **PROOF OWED:** real quarantine/inspection bytes, signed-in owner/admin/member/cross-tenant viewport and denial drives, and the Vercel runtime-log scan. Representative Gate 1 renders are design proof, not authenticated product proof.
- **Next owner:** Vault inspection adapter + service worker. It must read `docs/brain/codebase-map.md` → “Business Vault Phase 2 security foundation,” `docs/brain/decision-log.md` → 2026-09-06 Vault ruling, the UI evidence handoff, migrations `13700..14000`, and the 71-assertion SQL plan before provider selection. Explicit provider approval/credentials and real OCR/DLP/storage proof are required before binary intake can be enabled.

### The inbound MCP door — 119 tools, one governed decision, 68 mutations refused (2026-09-05, PR #960)

**Owner ruling:** *"An MCP connection authorizes access to the MCP door; it does not authorize
consequential action."*

**LIVE.** Every `tools/call` on `paige-mcp` passes one governed chokepoint — after the existing tier
and scope gate, before dispatch — so a refused act never reaches a handler. Effect was verified by
reading all 119 handler bodies with `file:line` evidence: **51 reads, 68 mutations**. Reads proceed
once tenant, tier, scope, actor identity and the server-resolved workspace check out. Mutations
refuse: **67 `approval_required`, exactly one (`create_tenant`) `owner_only`**. An unmapped tool
refuses `capability_unmapped`, and CI fails the build before it can ship.

**Do we HAVE MCP governance? Yes, at the caller layer, and this is the honest boundary.** The door
decides who may ask for what. It does NOT scope the query a handler then runs: thirteen of the 51
reads have no tenant predicate and return fleet-wide rows (tracked as task #46). No autonomy lane is
resolved on this surface — the door declares `not_resolved` rather than implying one, and refuses
every mutation regardless.

**One classifier, extended rather than forked.** `action-risk.ts` gained 52 canonical keys (62 → 114)
for MCP acts with no Chat twin; eleven MCP acts reuse existing keys. `list_tool_autonomy` gained the
matching catalogue rows AND the matching `WRITE_TARGET` entries, because a classified act with no
catalogue row is governed invisibly and one with no attribution target files a row saying only that
something happened. Classifying an act is a membership in three registries, not a label.

**Guards:** `lint:mcp-governed-door` (R1 every tool mapped · R2 no stale entries · R3 count parity ·
R4 the chokepoint still calls the adapter · R5 no second door · R6 no read-declared handler calls out
· R7 every canonical resolves in the one classifier), plus `lint:action-risk` taught the MCP
declaring surface and `lint:tool-catalogue` unchanged. 44 assertions over the real catalogue.

**Two deliberate §58 regressions:** 68 tools that worked stop working, and the `mcp.command` Rail feed
goes to zero because all twenty of its client-acting labels are mutations.

**Next slice (#47):** the approval channel that lets a person's approval, given inside Paige, reach
the door — which is what turns the refusals back into executions.

### Solo Campaigns → Social — a business can record the accounts it posts from (2026-09-05)

**What shipped.** `/solo/{account}/growth/social` was one fixed UNAVAILABLE panel. It is now a Social
Command surface — an executive brief composed only from figures that have a source, five KPI tiles, a
six-stage content pipeline, the accounts on record, what PAIGE has filed and stopped on, and the Trust
Compass lanes reflected read-only — and it carries the **first writer** `tenants.features->'social_handles'`
has ever had (`public.record_social_handles`, migration `20261210000000`). Systems Check #3
(`social_accounts_connected`) has pointed at this page since it shipped while admitting the page could
not finish the job; that caveat is gone in the same commit.

**PAIGE can now see AND change it.** New Spine capability `social.presence`
(`public.get_social_presence_evidence`), injected as a live per-turn block into every tenant Chat turn,
plus `get_social_accounts` / `record_social_accounts` in `paige-mcp`. The surface and PAIGE read the
same function, so they cannot describe the accounts differently.

**What is still UNAVAILABLE, and this narrows §5 rather than closing it.** A declared handle is a
§38 CAPTURE, not a connection. No follower, reach, engagement, publishing-queue, schedule or placement
figure exists for a tenant anywhere, and every tile that would imply one renders an em-dash plus the
sentence naming what would have to exist. **A live per-tenant social connection is NOT shipped:**
`meta-schedule-post`/`meta-get-insights` read a single platform-wide `META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
write `paige_social_posts`, a table with no `tenant_id` — so per-tenant publishing needs per-tenant
OAuth (provider app review, per-tenant tokens) and a tenant column on that table. Owner decision owed.

**Proof.** 53 new assertions, full suite 3303 passing, typecheck/build/lints green, and a production
`BEGIN..ROLLBACK` proof of ten assertions that **caught a real defect before merge** (the read's role
gate was unguarded on `auth.uid()` and would have refused PAIGE's own service-role caller).
**Proof owed:** migration applied on production (CI on merge) and an authenticated live drive (§32.c).
Full ledger: `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` → "Campaigns → Social".

### Solo n8n MCP OAuth read/write connection — 2026-09-03

PR #909 merged as 49b9f338. Frontend production deployment is READY on paigeagent.ai and app.paigeagent.ai; dedicated tenant-n8n-oauth version 1 and migration 20261201000000 are deployed and verified. Every Solo workspace owner can connect, edit, reconnect and disconnect through OAuth requesting workflow:read and workflow:write. API health remains independent. 3,020 Linux tests and all ordinary checks passed; rendered evidence covers four viewports and both themes. Final owner consent and real provider discovery are still Proof Owed. Hosted gateway callback URL retention is an accepted MVP residual risk, not a release blocker. See docs/delivery/solo-n8n-oauth-mvp.md.

### Solo Sales Ops — a Solo owner can record what one client agreed to (2026-09-03)

**P0 runtime correction LIVE (2026-09-06).** PR #985 merged the owner-approved redesign, but its
production adapter's first `loading`→`ready` transition changed React hook order and blanked the route.
PR #1001 fixed the hook-order defect and merged as `3f7eca584150a0af702451186cc638d863a01f98`;
Vercel deployment `dpl_5CxRh2iuFiSRgG5Bzwfn6n8RmfPH` is READY on the production aliases. The fix did
not change the approved design, route, tier, data, authority, or truth-label contract. Authenticated
owner live-drive stays PROOF OWED (§32.c) because the signed-in browser helper could not attach. Full
incident proof: `docs/evidence/ui-delivery/solo-sales-blank-route-hotfix.md`.
Original redesign record: `docs/brain/decision-log.md` (2026-09-06 MVP-close entry) +
`docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` "Sales Command Desk redesign". The merged redesign established an
evidence-aware **Sales Command Desk**: four internal views via a
Sales-local `?view=` param — Sales Command (Commercial Pulse · 6-stage Commercial Readiness Ladder ·
Top Commercial Moves · Open Commercial Work), Commercial Terms, Revenue & Collections, and a Sales
Scenario Lab (a model that writes nothing). Same surface, same tiers, no gating/route/migration change.
Every commercial figure carries an evidence class; Actual received stays unavailable, Contracted is
active one-time terms with recurring shown monthly (em-dash, never "$0"/"Free"), Contract-pending
unavailable. Verified: full suite 3563/3563, tsc ratchet 13/13, `drive:sales-ops` 524/524 with zero
horizontal/nested overflow across the real Solo content-column widths (to 439px). Authenticated
live-drive OWED (§32.c). Full §66 ledger: `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` → "the Sales Command Desk
redesign".

**Current usability status: PARTIAL.** Owner feedback explicitly rejects treating the current Sales UX as complete. PR #895 fixed recurring-date display only. **Release 1 usability repair is implemented in PR #903** on `codex/solo-sales-usability-r1`, refreshed onto main `bd32fd6`: functional drawer close/discard, reachable commercial-term editing, workspace cleanup, clearer controls, canonical Catalog/Clients return paths and removal of the oversized client-billing banner. The owner cleared the historical #706 shared-file collision; Pipeline implementation and six Campaigns tabs stay intact. See `docs/delivery/solo-sales-usability-r1.md` for the live product record and evidence. Local eight-frame drawer interaction proof passed; authenticated production persistence and owner acceptance remain **Proof Owed**. Merge and deployment evidence are recorded on PR #903.

The visible record is **Commercial terms and retainers**, not a legal-document lifecycle. Release 2 is a complete Client Agreements prototype, with tenant-uploaded attorney-approved documents first, and requires rendered owner approval before document storage, signature integration or external sends. Neither this record nor an Integration card proves such a provider is connected.

**Status: PR #889**, merged `096d6c9d`, migration `20261200000000` (verified persisted on prod; the
ledger row is present and is the ledger head). **§0 catch-up:** that PR did not update this file —
the tier matrix *was* updated in the same commit, so §66 was clean, but the master doc was the miss.
Slice 1 (Solo Catalog, PR #887 `c0b71f81`) has the same omission and is recorded below with it.

**What shipped.** `public.tenant_client_agreements` — the commercial agreement a Solo business has
with **one of its own existing clients**, against one canonical Catalog offer: term kind (one-time ·
recurring · installment · deposit · custom quote), the agreed amount and currency, cadence, start,
optional renewal and end, and a status of `draft` · `active` · `paused` · `completed` · `cancelled`.
The negotiated figure belongs to this client-specific commercial record. The Catalog price snapshot
is captured when terms are recorded and is immutable; repricing the offer cannot rewrite it.
Editing negotiated terms never writes back to Catalog, and recording terms is not signing a document. Writes go through `save_client_agreement` and `set_client_agreement_status`,
both `SECURITY DEFINER`, both gated on `is_tenant_admin` of the resolved tenant, both
`authenticated`-only with `anon` revoked. The tenant surface reads it via `src/solo/useSoloAgreements.ts`.

**§38 posture.** This is **not** a billing store. PAIGE is not merchant of record for tenant→client
revenue; nothing here is collected, settled, metered or reconciled by the platform, and no row has
touched a payment provider. The `status` vocabulary deliberately carries no `paid`, `invoiced` or
`delivered` — owner ruling, 2026-09-03: *"Do not fabricate payment or fulfillment status."*

**Visibility is inherited, not restated.** An agreement is visible iff its client is
(`tca_visible_with_its_client`), under a restrictive tenant gate (`tca_tenant_isolation`). The
restrictive half is load-bearing: without it, `clients_linked_self_read` would have let every portal
client read their own terms.

**Not connected to PAIGE.** **No Spine capability is registered against this source** — the registry
still carries three. What may and may not cross is defined in
`docs/delivery/sales-agreements-source-contract.md`; the placement decision belongs to Spine item 4
(Clients / Pipeline / Sales), issue #890. A worked but unexecuted draft resolver sits at
`docs/delivery/drafts/client-agreements-readiness.draft.sql` and is not applied.

**Owed (§13).** Authenticated runtime live-drive. Deferred and named: no deal or campaign link
(`useSoloCampaigns.ts:181` hardcodes `campaigns = []` on every tier); `payment_schedule` and `title`
exist as columns and are not yet reachable from the editor.

**Latent, inherited, not widened here.** `clients_admins_full` gates on `has_any_role()` against
`user_roles`, which carries no `tenant_id` — so an admin of any tenant who is also a member of
another can read that other tenant's client book and, through the `EXISTS`, its agreements. A
`clients`-owned defect, not one this table introduced. Re-check per release.

### PAIGE Rail — a workspace-level outcome record exists (SCR-2026-09-05, 2026-09-05)

**Status: MERGED and LIVE on prod** (`c5034b91`; `schema_migrations` row for `20261212000000`
present, `edge-live` and `db-live` both moved, zero drift). Migration
`20261212000000_paige_can_show_her_work.sql`. This is **SCR-1** from
`docs/architecture/paige-spine-tool-migration-map.md`, raised and approved by the owner on
2026-09-05 and recorded as `SCR-2026-09-05` in `docs/architecture/paige-spine-foundation.md`. The
map named it as the blocker on **47 of 60 actions and every wave from 3 onward**.

**Answer "can the owner see what PAIGE did?" from HERE, not from memory.** Measured on prod
2026-09-05 before the change: `paige_audit_log` 142 rows · `paige_workspace_events` **10** rows,
all connection events · `has_table_privilege('authenticated','paige_client_events','SELECT')` =
**false** (#746 open). So the result of **zero** of PAIGE's 60 Chat actions was owner-visible.

**What shipped.** One new `source_kind` (`capability_run`) with five outcomes, one new column
(`capability_key`), one service-role RPC (`record_capability_run`, actor must be an active member
of the tenant, §59), and the writer + display projection widened by delegation so no existing
family's body was retyped. `get_solo_rail_activity` passes the capability through;
`get_zapier_rail_activity` now also admits `capability_key='zapier_run_action'` so a Zapier run is
visible on the Zapier card. Also fixed: `record_zapier_mcp_connection_test` wrote a row on EVERY
health check (`gen_random_uuid(), 0` defeated its own de-dup key) and now records only a change.

**The READ half was already live and is NOT part of this** — `get_solo_rail_activity` already
unioned workspace events and `authenticated` already held EXECUTE (verified on prod). The gap was
vocabulary, not visibility.

**Wired so far: ELEVEN capabilities** — the six n8n writes, `zapier_run_action`, and (Wave 3, below)
the four Communications write acts. The remaining ~43 still write only `paige_audit_log`; each wave
adds its own copy. **Reads are never recorded.**

**Evidence.** Thirteen assertions against prod inside `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`, rollback confirmed; 3262
unit tests; `tsc`; `deno check` on all three edge modules; six CI lints. **UNVERIFIED and owed:**
§32.c authenticated live-drive that a row renders on the owner's Command Center.

**Measured 2026-09-05, after the merge:** `select count(*) from paige_workspace_events where
source_kind='capability_run'` returns **0**. The seam is live and nothing has exercised it — no n8n
or Zapier write has been run through Chat since it shipped. Read an empty feed here as "not yet
used", never as "broken".

**Flagged — a live cross-PR hazard, escalated to the owner 2026-09-05.** Open PR #776
(`claude/spine-w0-rail-recovery-746`, head `318f1dbd`) does `CREATE OR REPLACE
public.get_solo_rail_activity(integer)` at migration version **`20261042000000`** with a body that
reads **`paige_client_events` ONLY** — no workspace union. That version sorts BELOW the live
`20261212000000`, so it is invisible on a fresh `db reset` (CI stays green, live def wins) but on
**production** the deploy pipeline runs `db push --include-all` (`deploy-migrations.yml:153`), which
applies a behind-version migration LAST — its `CREATE OR REPLACE` then overwrites the live union and
**deletes every `capability_run` row's visibility**: n8n runs, `zapier_run_action`, and #947's four
Communications acts (§58 silent-removal, exactly the class §776's own PR body says it is guarding
against). A GitHub comment on #776 was **attempted and refused (403 — this integration cannot comment
on that PR)**, so the flag lives here and was raised to the owner directly instead. Resolution is the
#776 author's call: renumber above `20261213000000` and rebuild the body from the live definition
with their §59 guard, OR keep the version and add the `paige_workspace_events` union +
`capability_key` pass-through so out-of-order apply is idempotent. Their column allowlist and the
union return identical display columns, so option 2 discloses nothing extra.

### PAIGE Rail — Wave 3, Communications, and the outcome the five could not express (2026-09-05)

**Status: MERGED and LIVE on prod** (PR #947, squash-merge `2d91d1a1`, migration
`20261220000000_an_act_that_landed_but_was_not_recorded.sql`). Persisted-apply confirmed 2026-09-05:
`schema_migrations` carries `20261220000000` (prod head advanced from `20261213000000`), the sixth
outcome `capability_completed_unrecorded` is live in BOTH the outcome CHECK and the source
cross-check, and the live `_workspace_event_display` renders the sixth-outcome title and the four
comms labels. `db-live` and `edge-live` both at `2d91d1a1`; deploy-migrations #209 and
deploy-edge-functions #213 both green; zero migration drift. **Still owed (§32.c):** the
authenticated browser-drive that a row actually PAINTS on the Command Center — needs the owner or a
browser-capable session; the prod read proves the data reaches the reader, not that the component
renders it. Owner-sequenced ahead of everything else in the adoption plan, under the ruling: *"Every real-money
external action MUST record capability_run before it can be delegated at any autonomy tier above
'Ask first.'"*

**What shipped.** The four Communications acts that CHANGE something — `comms_buy_number` ·
`comms_name_number` · `comms_set_primary_number` · `comms_draft_registration` — record a workspace
Rail row, classified from each seam's OWN error taxonomy rather than from `success:false`. Plus a
**sixth outcome**, `capability_completed_unrecorded`, and its projection copy.

**Why a sixth outcome and not a near-miss.** `comms_buy_number` has two exits where Twilio has
charged the tenant and the `tenant_phone_numbers` row did not write. `capability_failed` promises
*"Nothing was left half-done"*; `capability_succeeded` claims a row exists; `capability_outcome_unknown`
says no result came back when one came back and said the charge landed. All three are false on the
one capability where being wrong makes someone buy the same number twice. The new outcome is
deliberately NOT money-specific — "the act took effect and its record did not" is a state every
later wave with external effects will reach.

**Recorded at the EXECUTOR, never at a central dispatch hook.** The hook design was taken apart
before it shipped: `record_capability_run` is service_role-only and the dispatch seam holds the
anon+JWT client, which returns `permission denied` as a **value, not a throw** — the feature would
have shipped with every gate green and written zero rows forever. Filed as lesson 0a in
`docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` so the next three adoption waves do not rediscover it.

**Evidence.** Pre-merge: 20 assertions against prod inside `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`, rollback confirmed
(0 rows, 0 migration rows) — including reading as the **authenticated
member** through `get_solo_rail_activity(50)`, the same RPC the Command Center calls, which returned
all four acts with their intended copy. 3358 unit tests (18 new); `tsc` ratchet 13→13 with none in
the changed files; `deno check` on the changed edge graph produced a diagnostic set **identical** to
`origin/main`'s (14 inherited on both legs); production build; nine CI lints. **UNVERIFIED and
owed:** the §32.c authenticated browser drive that a row actually paints.

**§39 peer-gate — blocked once, and it was right.** An independent adversarial read of the pushed
diff caught a false reassurance my own 20-assertion proof could not: `number_purchase_failed` was
classified `capability_unreachable` ("nothing changed"), but it is reachable only on a Twilio **2xx
with an empty body** — the charge may have landed — so it now falls to `capability_outcome_unknown`.
Two more, both fixed or documented: the row now records against the tenant the seam acted on
(`current_user_tenant_id()`), not the persona tenant that can diverge; and the recorder's member-seat
gate dropping cross-tenant-manager actors is documented in the tier matrix as an inherited, latent
gap for its own slice rather than widened here. Classification moved inside the recorder's try so it
cannot crash the turn.

**Flagged to the owner, deliberately NOT touched in this PR:**
1. **Revenue leak** — `comms-purchase-number` returns `charge_wired: false` on every success path.
   PAIGE pays Twilio for the number; the tenant is not billed for it. That is the owner's money
   decision (§38), not a code fix to make unilaterally.
2. **God/super_admin cannot reach the four comms tools at all** — the role gate is
   `admin || coach` with no `is_platform_owner()` branch. Owner-routed to its own PR.
   **RESOLVED 2026-09-05 (Communications closeout, Slice B):** the role gate now admits
   `super_admin` (`roles.includes("super_admin")`), so a verified God-tier operator can manage a
   tenant's Communications while acting inside that tenant (`operator_enter_tenant`). Admits
   super_admin ONLY — NOT `platform_admin` (a distinct role string) — the frozen super_admin grant
   (§53). Proven by 9 executed per-role assertions against the real handler

### PAIGE Spine — `team.authority`, and both readiness reads bound to their workspace (2026-09-03)

**Status: PR #876**, migrations `20261150000000` + `20261170000000`. The Spine registry now carries
**three** capabilities.

**What PAIGE can now accurately know.** Her caller's own **seat role** and **legal ownership of this
workspace**, as two separate facts, via `public.get_team_authority_readiness()`. Never a name, email,
user id, member count or invitation count — Team's own block already ships the last two, and a rival
computation would drift from it (its `invitation_count` has no status filter and reports 2 for a
workspace with zero outstanding invitations on production today; that is Team's to fix).

**Why two facts.** `get_paige_team_context()` computes permission as `is_owner OR role = 'owner'`,
wider than the canonical `is_tenant_owner()`, so one string would mean membership and ownership at
once. All 13 active members on production have the two agreeing, so nothing changes today — it stops
a future divergence from becoming a wrong answer.

**A cross-workspace defect fixed in the same change, found by independent review.**
`get_paige_persona_context()` resolves the conversation's tenant **client-link first**, so a user who
is a linked client of workspace B and a team member of workspace A holds a conversation scoped to B
while both readiness reads resolve A. Both reads now return the workspace they resolved and both Chat
adapters render nothing on mismatch. **This also fixed `business_context.readiness`, which shipped
with the same hole in #864.** Latent — production carries zero rows with `clients.linked_user_id`
set — and certain to fire once client portal users are linked.

**Still owed:** the authenticated UI drive. Bindings stay `PARTIAL`.

### PAIGE Spine — Connections read Setup for business fields (2026-09-03)

**Status: LIVE on production.** PR #878, merge `8689df61`, migration `20261160000000`.
`tenant_comms_readiness()` fed Solo Settings → Connections its "business name / website / business
phone" block from `tenants.brand` alone — the **fourth** consumer of the pointer #864 fixed, missed
because that sweep enumerated Systems Check *runners* and this is a comms resolver. Mogul Maker
Academy was being told on its own Connections screen that its website and phone were missing while
both sat in Setup. **Proven on production**, live function executed as that workspace's real owner:
`{has_name: true, has_phone: true, has_website: true}` — all three were `false` before. Twelve other
tenants unchanged.

**Deploy caveat (§32.a):** `deploy-migrations` went red on this merge with a `schema_migrations`
duplicate-key — Supabase's branching integration had already applied it. Prod is correct and
verified; the `db-live` tag did not move, so the drift check reports this applied migration as
unapplied until the next successful run. Recorded on incident #198.

### PAIGE Spine — `business_context.readiness` LIVE on production (2026-09-03)

**Status: RELEASED.** PR #864, merge `7ad98cff`, migration `20261112000000`. The Spine registry now
carries **two** capabilities, and this is the first **workspace-level** one.

> **Amended 2026-09-05 — PR #958, migration `20261221000000`.** Every fact this capability returns is
> now derived from **`public.business_identity_readiness`**, one internal resolver
> `tenant_comms_readiness` also reads, because the two were answering the same question differently
> for two real workspaces. New state `legacy_sourced` / source `legacy_brand` (present only in the
> legacy `tenants.brand` record, never confirmed) and a new `next_action` column on every row. The
> gate, the four `field_key`s and the always-four-rows promise are unchanged; no Systems Check
> verdict moves. See the §10 entry "Two readiness reads disagree…" and
> `docs/delivery/canonical-readiness-contract.md`.

**What PAIGE and Systems Check can now accurately know.** For the caller's own workspace, the status
and provenance of four Setup fields — `website`, `business_phone`, `industry`,
`primary_business_email` — via `public.get_business_context_readiness(uuid)`. Status and provenance
only; the URL, the number and the address never cross. Always exactly four rows, so "no signal" is
never confused with a read that failed quietly, and the absent states stay distinct:
`needs_confirmation` (nothing entered yet) vs `unavailable` (could not be read, with a reason).

**The defect it fixed, and why it was not staleness.** Setup's save path writes those fields into
`tenant_legal_profile` columns; three Systems Check runners and PAIGE's prompt were still reading
`tenants.brand`, which the current save path never writes. Re-running a scan could never fix that.
Measured on production: tenant `d8a0a880` held all three in Setup and none in `brand` — it was being
told all three were missing. The deployed contract, executed as that workspace's real owner, now
returns all three `owner_confirmed` from `setup`.

**Consumers, all live:** the three runners via one shared helper, PAIGE's per-turn chat context
block, and a Setup-save trigger firing the existing `systems-check-run-change`. `deploy-edge-functions`
shipped `paige-ai-chat`, `systems-check-run-change`, `systems-check-run-onboarding`,
`systems-check-run-scheduled`; drift is zero.

**Boundaries held:** Setup remains the sole writer and sole source of business facts; Connections
remains the authority for provider/connection-derived email; the Spine added exactly one read and
owns no copy of anything.

**PROOF OWED (§13):** the authenticated UI drive of the owner flow — blocked on unset
`LIVE_DRIVE_EMAIL` / `LIVE_DRIVE_PASSWORD`, **not** on browser capability (a claim made repeatedly
during this slice and since disproven: `npm run harness:selftest` drives real Chromium, and
production answers 200 from the sandbox — see `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` 0h). `chatBinding` and
`mindBinding` stay `PARTIAL` until that drive happens.

**OWNER DECISION SURFACED:** two tenants whose website/phone exist only in the legacy `tenants.brand`
now read `needs_confirmation`, flipping two checks from pass to fail. Correct under the
source-of-truth rule, but a visible change — see `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md`.


### The Canonical Solo Parity Program — Wave 0 baseline (2026-09-02)

**Status: standing program. Wave 0 RELEASED** — merged to `main` as `a289d0bc` (PR #783); **Wave 1
in flight: Settings → Team.** The objective is that every current and future Solo
account receives the same canonical Solo product template as `main`. Wave 0 shipped the baseline and
**no product change**. The inventory lives in `docs/doctrine/canonical-solo-parity-matrix.md` — every
Solo route, branch, sub-tab, Settings destination and PAIGE entry point, each marked canonical /
needs-authenticated-comparison / needs-UI-repair / backend-owned / Spine-owned /
intentionally-unavailable / parked.

**Canonical Solo shell policy — OWNER-RULED 2026-09-02.** Every **eligible standalone** Solo tenant
must receive the canonical Solo shell and product template represented by `main`;
`solo_shell_enabled` is the intended canonical end state. No tenant-brand, account-number, URL,
fixture or special-customer shell fork is permitted, and no exceptions are to be invented — an
exclusion is legitimate only from real platform eligibility, never customer preference. The ruling
does **not** authorize a bulk production flag mutation inside a parity baseline or a Settings
repair; enablement is routed to the controlled Solo Shell Rollout Audit
([#790](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/790)), which carries its own
exact-head Gate 2 and separate production-data authority.

**The load-bearing answer this file must now give.** Asked *"does every Solo account get the same
product?"*, the answer today is **not yet, and not because of a shell fork**. `src/pages/Admin.tsx:373-393`
mounts the canonical Solo shell only when that tenant's own `features.solo_shell_enabled` is `true`
(`src/hooks/useTenantContext.tsx:512`). Measured on production 2026-09-02: **4 of 7 top-level Solo
tenants carry the flag; 3 do not** and render the legacy `/admin` shell. Every parity repair reaches
4 of 7 Solo accounts until the owner rules on finishing the rollout. This is config-as-data behaving
as designed, not a defect — but it is the gap between "the template is correct" and "every account
receives it".

**Verified structure (read from code, test-asserted where noted).** 10 Solo branches and 45 sub-tabs
(`tierBranches.test.ts:200,215` — the file's own docblock saying 13/47 is stale). Only **6 branches
have a navigation entry**; `paige`, `trust-compass` and `automations` are aliases of Command Center
and `calendar` is addressable with no nav home by design. 8 Settings destinations, each carrying a
truth label in code (`src/solo/settings-contract.ts:95-102`). Production now has 13 tenants — 2
agency, 7 top-level Solo, 4 sub-account.

**Known and parked, not silently absorbed:** Clients › Delivery renders fabricated client records and
an invented PAIGE narrative ([#779](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/779) —
the only Solo surface presenting false tenant data as fact); Trust Compass headline numbers and its
autonomy dial are fixtures and its primary buttons only close the modal
([#780](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/780)); `paige:open` prompts are
authored by four call sites and read by none
([#781](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/781)); Solo documentation parity —
1 of 14 surface cards exist and the tier-matrix Solo ledger covers 1 of ~18 surfaces
([#782](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/782)).

**`UNVERIFIED` — authenticated comparison across two real Solo tenants.** The blocker is already on
record: `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md:1233` (2026-09-01) establishes that production *is* reachable
and that what fails is the browser's CONNECT tunnel, alongside unset
`LIVE_DRIVE_EMAIL`/`LIVE_DRIVE_PASSWORD`. Re-measured independently this session with the same
result. What this program adds: seven real Solo tenants exist, so the two-tenant comparison is
blocked on capability and credentials, **not** on tenant availability.


### Solo Settings → Setup — the visible-scroll policy (LIVE on production; merged 2026-09-02)

**Status: MERGED to `main` and deployed.** Gate 1 approved 2026-09-02; Gate 2 approved on exact
head `77d94c66`; merged as `1d189155` (PR #751). Recorded here per §0 because it changes an
owner-facing Solo capability **and the official Settings UI policy**, which is answered from this
file. **The authenticated owner browser proof below is still `UNVERIFIED` — shipping did not
satisfy it.**

**The owner-facing change.** Solo Settings → Setup now draws a visible, draggable main-content
scrollbar. Before this, it rendered 3,973–4,174px of business brief into a 702–934px host at every
supported Solo viewport — **78–82% below the fold on arrival with no scrollbar in either lane** — so
an owner could reasonably believe the first section was the whole page. It was the only one of the
eight Settings destinations that overflowed its host. Nothing about the business brief, its
information architecture, its fields, permissions or provider connections changed.

**The policy, as ruled (2026-09-02).** A Settings surface may use a clearly visible, accessible
main-content scrollbar when real configuration content materially exceeds the available viewport.

| Surface | Policy |
|---|---|
| **Settings → Setup** | **Visible scrollbar — newly authorized** |
| Settings → Connections (incl. Calendars), Settings → Integrations | Visible scrollbar — already authorized |
| Short Settings destinations that genuinely fit (Team, Notifications, Security & data, Vault, Billing) | Form-fitting |
| Command Center, Clients, Campaigns, Analytics | Form-fitting, design-locked — a separate owner ruling is required to change any of them |
| Marketplace | May use a visible main-region scrollbar when its content requires it. **Out of scope of this change; its code was not touched** |

**This is not a global scrolling rule for the platform.** The exception stays enumerated.

**Where the policy lives.** `SETTINGS_VISIBLE_SCROLL_DESTINATIONS` and
`settingsDestinationShowsScrollbar()` in
`src/components/tenant-shell/settings-scroll-contract.ts` — one value, read by both `SoloSettings`
and `settings-scroll-drive.mjs`, with a test asserting the two agree. It **fails closed**: an
unrecognised destination stays form-fitting. Adding a destination to it is a product decision
requiring an owner ruling, not a repair.

**Why the defect survived every guard.** The policy used to be
`const visibleScroll = tab === "connections" || tab === "integrations"`, and the only test of it
asserted that exact source line. Setup resolved `overflow-y: auto` from the same shared exception and
simply never received the class that *draws* the bar — so it could scroll and could not show that it
scrolled, and nothing failed. **No CSS changed in the repair**: the visible-scrollbar rules already
existed and were already correct.

**Canonical across all Solo tenants.** One shared shell, one shared policy value, no tenant, account
number, URL or fixture branch anywhere in the change. Verified structurally identical across two
synthetic Solo tenant contexts.

**A harness defect this exposed, and repaired.** The Settings drive had iterated `light` and `dark`
for weeks while rendering one palette both times: the harness used `forcedTheme`, which leaves
next-themes' `resolvedTheme` alone, and the shell stamps its own `data-pg` from `resolvedTheme`. So
**every "both themes" claim from that harness was one palette measured twice.** Repaired, and the
drive now scores the rendered token per environment instead of trusting the loop. Geometry is
theme-independent, so prior geometry results stand; prior colour claims from that harness do not.

**Evidence.** Rendered structural at 1536×770, 1366×768, 1024×768 and 900×1000 in both palettes:
Setup passes the full visible-scroll battery — bar visible with a stable gutter, wheel, End, PageDown,
Space and scrollbar drag all reach the last control, travel reaches the end, focus reaches the
spatially deepest control with a visible ring, keyboard visits every control, focus exits both
directions, one scroll owner, no horizontal overflow. Locked surfaces stay `overflow-y: hidden`.

**`UNVERIFIED`, and not claimed: authenticated owner browser proof.** No leg has been driven signed
in on the live platform. A reproduced-shell drive with a synthetic transport is structural evidence,
never authenticated proof — and the merge did not change that. **This is the one thing still owed on
this change**: sign in as a Solo owner → Settings → Setup → confirm a scrollbar is visible on arrival
at a laptop height → drag it to the bottom → confirm *How Paige uses it* is reachable → Tab from the
top and confirm focus stays on screen to the last control → open and fold PAIGE and confirm position
and keyboard path survive → repeat on a second Solo tenant.

department card, carried by PR #731) · `docs/brain/solo-settings-scroll-and-release-playbook.md`
(the Settings-scoped playbook — update owed, see that PR).

### PAIGE Mind — a recorded Pipeline outcome, read and cited (LIVE on production, capability `PARTIAL`) — 2026-09-02

**Evidence, on current `main`.** Merged in **PR #747** as `dcddf6761e84cc298588b6fbe1c39c61a5ec5fc8`,
after owner Gate 2 at exact head `b43b15395ca300b8d2746ee36ac70828f6fd82da`. Vercel production
deployment `dpl_AypwRwqAWfAEyB74tbNT7XcLy8nq` is `READY` at that commit; `deploy-edge-functions` and
`deploy-migrations` both succeeded and moved `edge-live` and `db-live` to it, with zero drift on
either. Applied on prod ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu` (§32.a, queried rather than assumed):
`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` carries `20261041000000`, the re-created projection exists,
and it emits `client_id` from the visibility-filtered clients join rather than from the deal row.
All five post-merge workflow runs on that commit are green.

**Owner job.** Ask PAIGE what a client's recorded Pipeline stage outcomes actually prove, and get an
answer that names its source rather than inferring past it.

**Human surface.** Solo Growth → Pipeline (`/solo/{account}/growth`) → a deal card → **Open PAIGE for
this client**, which scopes the Solo PAIGE fold to that deal's client. Scope is UI context only: the
server re-resolves tenant by `current_user_tenant_id()` and re-authorizes the client before any read,
and the scope clears on a client or account switch.

> **THE ENTRY PATH WAS BROKEN AND IS NOW REPAIRED IN CODE — issue #765, PR #773 (`f7fe9718`).**
> Found post-merge on `dcddf6761e`: setting a client scope reset history hydration, which
> auto-resumed the newest saved thread, which released the focus just set. The scope was dropped

**PAIGE capability, stated exactly.** She can read safe, tenant-scoped and client-scoped recorded
Pipeline outcome evidence through the merged safe lens `public.get_pipeline_spine_evidence`, state
what it proves, cite the opaque `rail:<uuid>` record reference, mark a stale record as old rather
than current, and say plainly when nothing is recorded — an empty read is never reported as proof
that no activity occurred. **She cannot move, create, archive, delete, route or approve a Pipeline
deal through this capability.** No Pipeline Chat write tool and no approval path exists here:
`classification: read`, `riskPolicyKey: read_only`, `approvalAuthority: none`.

**The citation is the one identifier permitted to cross** (owner-approved Spine Change Request,
2026-09-02). It names a record, not a person or a deal, and is asserted to appear only inside the
citation. Title, summary, payload, stage name, deal id, contact/client/user/tenant ids, provider
bodies, secrets and reasoning traces all stay forbidden.

**Truth label: `PARTIAL`, not `LIVE`, and neither this release nor the #765 repair lifts it.** Still
owed and still `UNVERIFIED`: an authenticated owner drive on two Solo tenants, rendered proof at
1536×770, 1366×768, 1024×768 and 900×1000, and `supabase test db` with a full-history replay. **The
owed authenticated drive is exactly what would have caught #765** — every layer below the entry path
was proven, and the one thing not driven is the one thing that failed (§70: a wired code path is not
a usable capability). That lesson stands after the repair, because the repair is also code-proven
only. Detail:
`docs/delivery/paige-spine-mind-handoff.md`; per-tier rows: `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` (§66
ledger). Parked, not started: issues #748, #749, #750, #766, #769, #770, #771, #772. (#765 is REPAIRED — PR #773, `f7fe9718`.)

**Next required lane, not started:** the Pipeline Chat Write Bridge (§5) needs its own Gate 1.

### Solo Team — PAIGE can act on the team (LIVE on production, capability `PARTIAL`) — 2026-09-02

**2026-09-03 invitation-security P0:** a direct legacy consumer bypassed recipient binding. PR #900 hardens both Solo token consumers; isolated 110-assertion proof passes, production verification pending. [Bounded repair and separated evidence](delivery/solo-team-recipient-binding-p0.md). The owner-confirmed send leg remains LIVE; fresh-account end-to-end acceptance remains Proof Owed.

**Evidence, on current `main`.** Merged in **PR #728** (`76bb3bbca`, *PAIGE Spine foundation registry
and safe Pipeline evidence*), not through #675. Applied on prod ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`:
`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` carries `20261039000000` and `20261040000000`, and
`list_tool_autonomy()` returns all five `team_*` rows under the `Team` category. Documentation record:
**PR #675** (`05735f26b`) and **PR #730** (`ed22066e7`, which reconciled this file to the live
capability) — both documentation only, shipping no code.

**Owner job.** Manage the people in a workspace: team members, invitations, work details, roles and
access.

**Human surface.** Solo Settings → Team (`/solo/{account}/settings/team`, `SoloTeamWorkspace`).

**PAIGE capability.** She may propose and execute the governed Team actions **only through the
canonical approval route**. She reads a server-resolved, active-tenant roster block; she may lift a
`member_user_id` or `invitation_id` out of it, never a name she resolved herself. Every act runs
through the same seam the Team screen uses — the two RPCs under the caller's own JWT, the three
invitation acts through the `solo-team-invitations` edge function — so the database's in-body
authority checks apply to a sentence exactly as to a form. A tenant-agreement precondition refuses
when the seam's workspace is not the one the conversation is about.

| Tool | Risk | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| `team_invite_member` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `team_invite_resend` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `team_invite_revoke` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `team_set_permission` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `member_grant_role` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `member_revoke_role` | `high` | the real owner approval card |
| `team_set_work_profile` | `ordinary` | normal compact confirmation |

`high` means the gate accepts only a fingerprint of the exact rendered card, carried in the request
**body** — a channel the model cannot write. The model asserting consent is refused.
**`team_set_work_profile` is `ordinary` and is NEVER a permission change**: the RPC writes a job
title and responsibilities and cannot reach `permission`. Any copy implying otherwise is false.

**Truth label: `PARTIAL`, not `LIVE`** — see `docs/doctrine/surface-cards/team.md`.

**The live limitation.** **Owner-visible workspace-level outcome history is still missing.** A Team
action emits no Rail event: `emitRailForTool` returns early on `if (!contactId) return`, because the
Rail is per-client and a Team action has no contact. That early return is correct — emitting one
anyway would invent a client involvement. An attribution row IS written to `paige_audit_log`,
tenant-stamped and complete, but **no Solo surface reads `paige_audit_log`**. So a permission change
PAIGE makes on a team does not appear in that team's own activity feed.

**Owed, and not claimed:** authenticated owner browser proof of the Team flow **remains owed**. No
leg of it has been driven on the live authenticated platform, and the capability is already serving
production.

**Unstarted:** the workspace-level outcome projection — safe actor, action, target member or
invitation, approval binding, result, owner-visible evidence — is an **unstarted Spine Change
Request** in its own coordinated workstream. Owner ruling 2026-09-02: a Team event is not a client
event, and no client Rail event may carry a null `contact_id`.

**Separate and still active:** **PR #728's post-merge P1/P2 hotfix is a live workstream, and nothing
in this documentation repairs it or makes it irrelevant.** Two of its P1s land on surfaces named
above — `useRailEvents` can merge the previous scope's events into the feed after a tenant or contact
switch, and `useSoloPendingActions` keeps the previous tenant's pending actions on the Trust Compass.
The other two P1s are in `paige-apply-extraction`; the P2 is a failed Skip leaving a proposal
unretryable.



### PAIGE Spine — tool migration state (planning record, 2026-09-02; NO capability changed)

**Measured on `origin/main` `e3592089` by running the repository's own guards, not from memory.**

| Measure | Value | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Inline legacy Chat tools | **105** | `npm run lint:chat-tool-registry` |
| Registered Spine capabilities | **1** | `scripts/ci/paige-spine-registry-lint.mjs` |
| Classified actions | **62** — 32 `ordinary` · 28 `high` · 2 `owner_only` · 5 exempt · 0 unclassified writes | `npm run lint:action-risk` |

**The Spine is PARTIAL and no department-wide connectivity is implied.** The one registered
capability is `pipeline.deal_stage_evidence` — a read, `chatBinding: PARTIAL`, and **`mindBinding:
PARTIAL` since #747 merged (`dcddf676`, 2026-09-02)**, mapped to **no** Chat tool. The guards were
re-run on the merged head: 105 · 1 · 62, all unchanged. PAIGE reaches every department today through the 105
hand-wired tools, not through the Spine.

**Two of the 62 classified actions are not Chat tools at all** — `marketplace_install` and
`marketplace_uninstall`, already on record above as containment tombstones. The migration map
re-derived this independently and confirms it; it is not a new find. The real install path is the
`marketplace-install` edge function, which the Chat gate never sees (#740).

**Leg 7 — *owner can see the truthful result* — is closed for 100% of PAIGE's writes.** Of the 60
classified actions that are Chat tools, **13** emit a per-client Rail event whose production read is
denied (#746), and **47** emit only a `paige_audit_log` row, which has no Solo reader. This is why
no mutating capability can be labelled `LIVE` today, regardless of how well it is built.

**Migration is phased and governed.** The plan is
`docs/architecture/paige-spine-tool-migration-map.md` — every one of the 105 tools carries exactly
one disposition (**13 Migrate · 79 Spine Change Request · 3 Keep unavailable · 10 Retire**), nine
sequenced waves, a CI-ratchet proposal, and the ten-condition `LIVE` standard. Wave issues:
[#756](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/756) (foundation) ·
[#757](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/757) ·
[#755](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/755) ·
[#758](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/758) ·
[#759](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/759) ·
[#760](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/760) ·
[#761](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/761) ·
[#762](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/762) ·
[#763](https://github.com/mrmogulmaker-bot/Paige-Agent-AI/issues/763).

**No legacy tool is considered live through this plan.** The map is a planning record. It migrated
nothing, enabled nothing, and promoted no label. Three Spine Change Requests it identifies — a
workspace-level outcome projection, non-client subject types, and a record/list evidence shape —
are **unrequested and unstarted**, and every wave after the foundation depends on at least one.

### Paige's tool confirmation is bound to SERVER-HELD state (2026-09-01, `20261021000000`)

`confirm:true` on a mutating tool is no longer decided by the model's own output. The autonomy gate
in `paige-ai-chat` mints a `paige_tool_confirmations` row on every `needs_confirm`, and a later
`confirm:true` executes ONLY by atomically consuming a row for that tool, requester and tenant that
is unspent, unsuperseded, unexpired, and **created before the current turn began**. Minting
supersedes any earlier open proposal for the same tool, so one approval buys exactly one execution.

For a list of high-consequence tools (`TOOL_IDENTITY_FIELDS`) the row also pins an identity. Some
of those values ARE shown to the operator (the phone number, the role, a workflow or page id);
others — `user_id`, `contact_id`, `number_id` — are **not**, and the pin there buys less than it
looks like: a mismatch re-renders the *same* sentence, so a second yes executes on the new subject.
It closes an accidental swap; it does not let the operator tell two subjects apart. Naming the
subject in the summary is filed separately.

It deliberately does **not** pin whole arguments: history carries only `{role, content}`, so the
model re-authors its arguments from prose on the confirming turn, and hashing a `document_generate`
payload made the flow unapprovable.

**Any user turn satisfies the gate — including "no, don't."** This proves a turn intervened, never
that the operator agreed.

**Both versions before this one were BLOCKED by the §39 peer-gate**, the first for that
whole-argument hash, the second for a supersede that keyed on the tool alone while the claim keyed
on tool+identity — which livelocked any *batch* ("delete these two contacts") in exactly the same
silent way. Neither was reachable by the SQL proof or the unit tests as they stood.

**What this closed.** The gate previously tested `gateArgs.confirm`, which is
`JSON.parse(tc.function.arguments)` — the model's own output. A model emitting `confirm:true` on
its first call executed immediately; and because the tool loop dedupes rounds on the exact argument
string, it could even propose and self-approve **inside a single HTTP turn** with no operator
message in between. `MUTATING_TOOLS` carried **52 entries** when this was written, two of which (`marketplace_install`,
`marketplace_uninstall`) are containment tombstones with no tool definition and no dispatch branch
and can never reach it. **Re-measured 2026-09-02 on `e3592089`: 62** (`npm run lint:action-risk`) — the
set is `mutatingTools()`, i.e. every entry in the risk policy, and Solo Team, Comms and Pipeline have
added to it since. The two tombstones are unchanged and are still the only two with no tool definition. The rest include `member_grant_role`,
`n8n_delete_workflow`, `zapier_run_action` and `comms_buy_number`.

**What it does NOT claim (§13).** It proves the server proposed first, that a turn intervened, that
what runs is what was proposed, and that an approval is spent once. It does **not** prove the human
said *yes*. Binding to an authenticated approval click needs per-surface UI work — only
`PaigeAIChat` renders `PaigeConfirmCard`, and `useSoloChat` drops the confirm frame — and is
tracked separately. `auto` is unchanged and still carries no confirmation, by design (§67).

**§18:** generalizes `pipeline_archive_confirmations` (#709), which already did this for one tool.
Not a rival seam. **Proof:** 11/11 behavioural assertions against prod inside `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`
via the committed `scripts/tool-confirmation-sql-proof.sql`, plus 46 unit tests including explicit
livelock regressions. Inside a studio thread `STUDIO_AUTO_TOOLS` still flips five build tools to
`auto`, so the binding does not reach those there.

**MERGE CORRECTION, 2026-09-02 (§13).** The binding above shipped, and the branch below
replaces the RUNTIME half of it: `paige-ai-chat` now gates on `paige_pending_confirmations`,
which proves everything the row above proves and additionally executes the STORED arguments
and requires the operator's Approve click — the two things #711 recorded as NOT proven. The
`paige_tool_confirmations` table and `_shared/toolConfirmation.ts` remain in place but are no
longer on the execution path. See `docs/brain/decision-log.md`, 2026-09-02.

### PAIGE Chat — the governed working interface (2026-08-31; **MERGED and LIVE via PR #728 `76bb3bbca`**, 2026-09-02)

**Status CORRECTED 2026-09-02 — the original text is preserved below it, not deleted (§58).**
~~*On a branch, verified, awaiting Gate 2. Nothing below is live on production yet.*~~ **This work is
MERGED and LIVE on production.** It reached `main` through **PR #728** (`76bb3bbca`), not through
#675; #675 was rebuilt on `main` and merged as documentation only (`05735f26b`). Verified rather than
inferred: `main` carries every migration named below and its `paige-ai-chat` handler is a superset of
the branch's. Recorded here per §0 so the next session does not re-diagnose any of it.

Six vertical slices, each independently reviewed by an adversarial agent, repaired, and re-verified.

| Slice | What changed | Where |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Every provider call files its `paige_llm_trace` row under the tenant whose evidence it carries. Eight of nine call sites passed no trace context and wrote untenanted platform rows — the ones carrying the MOST evidence. | `paige-ai-chat`, `_shared/claude.ts` seam |
| S2 | A focused-CLIENT switch now ends the conversation the way an account switch does (one composite scope epoch). The isolation fence stopped being opt-in — the one surface that focuses clients did not set the flag. `paige_chat_turn_append` gained a tenant predicate. A refused client focus is released, and the refusal survives the reset it causes. | `PaigeAIChat.tsx`, `PaigeWorkspace.tsx`, migration `20261018000000` |
| S3 | **A credit report dropped into chat no longer writes eight tables unasked.** It produces a proposal a person reviews field by field; approval carries KEYS, never values, and the server writes from its own stored extraction. Prohibited sensitive categories excluded; uncertainty omitted rather than defaulted. | `paige-ai-chat`, new `_shared/credit-extraction-payload.ts`, new `paige-apply-extraction`, migration `20261019000000` |
| S4 | An approval is BOUND to the call it approved, not to a boolean. `update_client_data` and `delegate_to_subagent` entered the gate. The autonomy catalogue now covers every gated tool (was 23 of 46). **The Trust Compass now actually clamps** what Paige may do unattended. **The binding MECHANISM changed twice after this — read R1 and R2 below before trusting any description of it.** | `paige-ai-chat`, migrations `20261020000000`, `20261039000000` (renumbered from `20261021000000` on the 2026-09-02 merge — that version was already taken on prod by main's tool-confirmation binding) |
| R1 | S4's mechanism (the surface echoes a fingerprint back) made every gated tool **un-executable on five of the six chat surfaces**, because only `PaigeAIChat` sends the echo — and the client-portal seat lost `update_client_data`, its only write. The proposed call is now persisted and approval carries a TOKEN; the STORED arguments execute, so the model never restates the call and a document-sized argument cannot livelock. | `paige-ai-chat`, migration `20261023000000` |
| R2 | **R1 opened a self-approval hole and this closes it — see §10.** The nonce (a token cannot be redeemed by the turn that minted it) held, but was not enough: the token is a fingerprint of the ACTION, so any LATER request that re-proposed the same call got it back and spent it — including one whose human message was "cancel that". **The token is removed.** Approval is a rendered card (unforgeable — a model cannot write a request body) or `confirm: true` (the model's word); both redeem the STORED call. Declining now CANCELS the proposal. | `paige-ai-chat`, migration `20261026000000`, `PaigeConfirmCard.tsx` |
| R3 | **The risk split became a policy.** `_shared/action-risk.ts` classifies all 51 mutations once — 28 `ordinary` (either channel), 21 `high` (rendered card only; the model's word is refused), 2 `owner_only` (not a chat action at any approval strength). `MUTATING_TOOLS` is that policy's key set, so there is no second list to drift out of step. An unclassified write refuses at dispatch AND fails CI (`lint:action-risk`). **Owner ruling 2026-09-01 absorbed:** Paige may never grant or raise her own autonomy through Chat, so `automation_set_grant`/`automation_set_state` refuse down every channel including a clicked card. | new `_shared/action-risk.ts`, `paige-ai-chat`, new `scripts/ci/action-risk-lint.mjs` |
| A | §67 **the process record**: `paige_automations` + `paige_automation_acts` + a trigger catalogue. A grant is fingerprinted over the act chain, so changing the chain drops an `auto` grant back to `confirm` — the human approved a specific sequence. | migration `20261022000000` |
| B | §67 **the resolver**: `resolve_automation_autonomy` = `min(grant, most restrictive act floor, Trust Compass ceiling)`, returning `capped_by` (which bound is holding it) and `dark` (why it could never fire) as separate answers. | migration `20261024000000` |
| C | §67 **the chat seam**: five tools. A tenant describes repeatable work and Paige builds it — born `confirm` + `draft`, explicitly, whatever the request said. **She can build a process; she can never arm one.** Two of the five (`automation_set_grant`, `automation_set_state`) became `owner_only` under R3 and now refuse in chat outright — so **`paige_automations.granted_lane` and `.state` are currently settable by nothing**, the Settings control being owed to CD (§00). Automations were already inert (no trigger emits), so nothing regressed. | `paige-ai-chat`, migration `20261025000000` |
| C1 | **Every write Paige performs now says what changed, for whom, on whose authority, and whether it worked.** Ten of forty-nine mutations reached the per-client rail and three wrote a bespoke `audit_logs` row; everything else — publishes, documents, provider calls, role grants, deals, plans — left no trace, and the rail's `ref_id` was hardcoded null so even a mirrored event could not name the record it changed. One seam at the point every executed tool passes through, into `paige_audit_log` (which already carries `tenant_id`). The rail's membership is derived from the same target map, which added `update_client_data` — the most-used per-client write, and the client seat's only one. **A `client` seat could not record its own action at all** (the insert policy required `is_staff`), and a tenant-level admin could read every UNTENANTED audit row; both closed. | `paige-ai-chat`, migration `20261027000000` |
| M1 | **Paige opens knowing what she is carrying.** A transcript is what was SAID, not what is OWED, and it does not survive a new thread, a compaction, or a person returning a week later. Everything needed already existed in four places and nothing read them together. `paige_operating_memory()` composes open commitments (`plan_items`), live processes (`paige_automations`), work in flight including anything stopped at an approval (`paige_actions`), and what she last did with its real outcome (`paige_audit_log`) — **nothing is stored, so no copy can go stale.** SECURITY INVOKER so RLS stays the boundary; **no tenant parameter at all** — scope is `auth.uid()` + `current_user_tenant_id()`. A failed read renders NOTHING rather than implying nothing is outstanding. | migration `20261028000000`, `paige-ai-chat`, `_shared/client-context.ts` |
| M2a | **Three semantic reads had been raising on every call, and nobody could see it.** `match_paige_memory` (semantic client memory), `match_rag_documents` (document retrieval) and `match_prompt_memory` (the §26 prompt-forge loop) pin `search_path = public` — correct DEFINER practice — but the `vector` type and all sixteen of its operators live in `extensions`, so `<=>` could not resolve and each raised **42883** before returning a row. Driven on prod as a fully authorised caller, so it was never about permissions. **`match_rag_documents` was broken twice**: past the operator error it hit `42P01` from `array_agg(r.id)` over a subquery aliased `d` — one stray token in 3,033 characters, unreachable until now. Every call site degrades to an empty result, which is why "no matches" and "cannot execute" were indistinguishable for months. `lint:vector-path` now fails any similarity function that cannot resolve its own operator. | migration `20261029000000`, new `scripts/ci/vector-search-path-lint.mjs` |
| M2b | **`client_memory` had no tenant isolation at all** — no tenant column, no restrictive policy, and its widest policy keyed on `has_role(auth.uid(),'admin')`, which is tenant-agnostic (§59). Driven: tenant A's admin read **2 of tenant B's** client memories. Zero rows today, and chat writes into it every turn, so it fills the moment the product is used. Closed by DERIVING the tenant (`client_id → clients.tenant_id`, and for owner rows the subject's `tenant_members`) in a RESTRICTIVE policy — **no producer changes**, which matters because the §37 inventory is 9 edge functions, 6 frontend surfaces and MCP tools, several belonging to surfaces this project does not own. Also: `user_preference` is written at two sites and was rejected by the CHECK (23514, driven) — every preference Paige ever detected was thrown away. | migration `20261030000000` |
| D1 | **Paige files a note to the right client, on confirmation.** `crm_add_note` writes `client_notes` — the panel a team actually reads, keyed on the contact record — through the CALLER's client so RLS applies. The routing decision is a model's, so the destination is resolved against the caller's tenant before anything is written, and the insert policy now requires it too (a note could previously be filed onto ANOTHER tenant's client while stamping your own — driven, and not a read leak, which is why it would never have been noticed). Visibility is stated rather than offered: `client_notes` has no client-facing read policy at all, so staff-only is a fact, and the card says so. Lands on the client's rail and in the write trail. **The DOCUMENT half is NOT built and is blocked, not deferred:** `public.documents` has no `tenant_id` and owner-only policies, so a document filed to a client would be invisible to the team that filed it — a contract gap on a table this project does not own. | migrations `20261031000000`, `20261032000000` |
| S5 | The automatic URL fetch is tier-gated — a portal client pasting a link no longer causes server-side egress. (The raw provider-payload spread was already closed on `main` by the MCP registry work; nothing rebuilt.) | `paige-ai-chat` |
| S6 | Removed four claims with no capability behind them: three dead composer shortcuts, an unbound ⌘K, a panel saying voice input was off while the mic worked, and a session-summary hook that had been sending `Bearer undefined` since it was written. | `PaigeAIChat.tsx`, `TenantCommandCenterShell.tsx`, `SoloPaigeWorkspace.tsx`, `usePaigeMemory.ts` |

**§13 — WHAT IS NOT DONE, so nobody reads the above as more than it is.**
- **No authenticated live drive.** This session has no browser capability; every §70.1 gate item that
  requires a person completing the flow on the real platform is **owed to a capable session** (§32.c).
- **Migrations are rollback-proven, not persisted.** Each was driven on production Postgres inside
  `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` with negative controls. The §32.a persisted-apply confirmation is owed AFTER a
  merge the owner authorizes.
- **`runGeneralDocumentExtraction` is still undefined** — called, never defined, one of the 14
  baseline `deno check` errors. Non-credit documents therefore still produce no proposal.
- **`paige-mcp` does not consult `resolve_tool_autonomy`** — a second, still-ungoverned write path.
  Pre-existing, NOT introduced by this branch. It is scope-enforced (`workflows.run` etc.), not
  lane-enforced. Deliberately not fixed here: MCP callers have no confirm affordance, so gating it
  would make every MCP write un-executable — the exact failure R1 exists to undo.
  - **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-05 (PR #960), and the prediction was right.** All 119 MCP tools now pass
    one governed door; the 68 verified mutations refuse (67 `approval_required`, `create_tenant`
    `owner_only`), which IS "every MCP write un-executable", ruled for explicitly by the owner:
    an MCP connection authorizes access to the door, not consequential action. The lane is still
    not resolved on that surface — the door declares `not_resolved` and refuses regardless, so the
    refusal is a property of the channel rather than of a workspace setting. Giving MCP a way to
    carry a person's consent is the named next slice; the note above is kept because it named the
    cost before it was paid.
- **Approval on five of the six chat surfaces is still MODEL-ASSERTED.** A new request proves a
  person sent another message, not that the message was a yes. Only a surface that renders the
  summary and echoes back its fingerprint proves a human approved THAT call, and one surface does
  (`PaigeAIChat`). Building the card on the other five is interface work owed to CD (§00).
- **Triggers do not EMIT yet** (slice D of the autonomy architecture). Four trigger rows are seeded —
  only the ones verified against production — not the eighty the design pack declares, because
  `is_live` is the field a builder trusts to decide what it may offer a tenant.
- **Design items are owed to CD**, listed in `docs/delivery/PAIGE-CHAT-DELIVERY-MAP.md` §4b.

**Live platform finding, surfaced by the S4 proof and worth an operator's attention on its own:**
`operator_rls_coverage` is **FAILING** on production, which is already capping the platform's trust
ceiling from 3 to 2 via the §68 decay law.

**Full map:** `docs/delivery/PAIGE-CHAT-DELIVERY-MAP.md` (estate grounding, ordered slices, collision
ownership, what is owed to CD).

### §65 operator route tree — AUTHORED from the Super Admin design pack (2026-08-18, PR #541)

- ✅ **`OPERATOR_BRANCHES` is authored** (`src/lib/routing/tierBranches.ts`) — **13 branches / 5 settings
  groups / 78 addressable tabs**, GENERATED by executing Claude Design's own `paige-routes.js` rather than
  transcribed. Replaces the §11e placeholder that said "authored when the pack lands."
- ✅ **Shape:** operator paths carry **no account segment** (`TierTree.accountSegment=false`, §65 matrix row
  1), and **settings has a third level** (`/operator/settings/team/roles`) via an optional `SubTab.subtabs`
  used ONLY by the operator settings branch. Five invariant tests guard the addressing contract.
- ✅ **The Settings back-menu is specified:** Setup · Integrations · **Platform Team (Seats · Roles)** ·
  Platform Vault · Governance — this is the roles/permissions home the owner asked for, now addressable.
- ❗ **§13 correction:** an earlier claim that `/operator` was a login-vs-console *collision* was WRONG —
  the pack has **zero** routes at bare `/operator` (verified by executing its registry). It is a prefix; the
  login keeps the root as an index leg.

### §65 R4 slice 1b — the operator console is MOUNTED (2026-08-18, PR #543)

- ✅ **All 78 addresses are live and navigable** at `/operator/{branch}/{subtab}` (and
  `/operator/settings/{group}/{tab}`), resolved from `OPERATOR_BRANCHES`. This closes the "authored ≠
  mounted" gap the 1a entry above recorded. Three new files: `src/operator/OperatorEntry.tsx` (3-leg
  dispatcher — index + login + guarded console, peer to `AgencyEntry`/`BusinessEntry`),
  `RequireOperator.tsx` (**ONE** guard above all 78 routes, not 78 copies), `OperatorApp.tsx` (the
  URL-driven left-rail shell). `App.tsx`'s `/operator` exact route became a `/operator/*` splat.
- ✅ **The guard reuses what already resolves** — `isPlatformStaff || isPlatformOwner` from
  `useTenantContext`; the staff flag is populated from `is_platform_admin()`, semantically identical to
  §53's `is_platform_operator()`. No new RPC, no second async hop, no fork of `AgencyLayout`'s waterfall
  (§18). `loading` is gated FIRST and unconditionally — the "Restricted area" latch bug already shipped
  once on `/admin/platform/*`, and at a subtree root its blast radius is all 78 routes at once.
- ✅ **§53 gating is on the ROUTE, not only the nav.** `revenue` + `comms` are owner-only (their shipped
  twins `MoneySpineAdmin` / `PlatformFleetCommunications` are both `<PlatformOwnerOnly>`) — a hidden tab
  whose route stays open is not a gate. **7 MIXED branches** (fleet · paige · growth · analytics ·
  provisioning · marketplace · settings/governance) carry owner-only tabs INSIDE an operator-level
  section; those inner gates land WITH their surfaces rather than being guessed against a placeholder.
- ✅ **NEW shared token `--rail` / `--rail-foreground`** (`index.css` + `tailwind.config.ts`). The rail is
  `--primary` in light, but on dark `--primary` lifts to a vivid 56%-L indigo — a violet slab where the
  design wants a quiet panel. Own token pair per theme; the dark value is lifted **well clear** of
  `--background` (~1.45:1 as a large adjacent surface + an explicit `--border-strong` edge) because the
  source design's own rail is the same colour as its dark page and **vanishes** — a real source defect we
  do not reproduce (§29 perceptibility). §11 "add it to the layer," never an inline hex.
- ✅ **Accessibility was AUTHORED, not ported.** The pack's entire chrome is `div + onClick` — zero
  `button`, zero link, zero `role`, zero `aria-current`, zero focus-visible. Shipped as real `<Link>`s
  with `aria-current`, real `<button>`s with `aria-expanded`/`aria-label`, and indigo focus rings
  throughout. Two source AA failures fixed rather than copied (rail eyebrows 4.11:1 · route path 2.84:1).
- ✅ **OWNER RULING 2026-08-18 — CLAUDE DESIGN IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH.** *"If Claude Design made it,
  that's how it's supposed to be moving forward. Whatever we had before CD is no longer valid. None of
  it!"* An earlier pass on this slice substituted our pre-CD conventions for three of CD's calls and
  flagged them OWNER-OWED; the ruling **reverses all three** and they shipped in the same PR:
  CD's **gold** is back on the active sub-tab underline and the settings-active rail rows (CD's own two
  treatments, which the earlier pass had unified on white), and **CD's warm palette** replaces our cool
  indigo. Delivered as a **scoped `.operator-console` token block** in `index.css` — the pattern
  `.studio-surface` already establishes — so CD's design lands exactly where CD designed it and **no
  other surface, including owner-approved §28-frozen ones, is repainted as a side effect.** Zero hex at
  any call site; the CD-vs-platform decision is made in exactly ONE place (the `operator-console` class).
  **Verified in the BUILT bundle, not asserted:** `--background` → `rgb(252,250,248)` vs CD's `#FBF9F7`,
  `--rail` → `rgb(25,18,48)` vs `#191231`, `--cd-gold` → `rgb(200,158,45)` vs `#C8A02E` — within 1–2 per
  channel (HSL rounding, not a choice).
- ❗ **TWO CD values not copied verbatim — recorded, not quietly changed (§13/§29).** CD's rail eyebrow
  measures **4.11:1** and CD's dark block paints the page the SAME colour as the rail so the rail
  **vanishes**. Those read as artifacts of the pack rather than design intent (the §29 "shipped, correct,
  invisible" class); each keeps CD's hue and moves only far enough to be seen. CD's gold underline
  measures **2.35:1** — raised once, ruled on, ships as designed.
- ✅ **OWNER RULING 2026-08-18 — "I only want the backend to now connect to our new front end."** This
  re-points the remaining console slices: they wire REAL backends **into** these CD surfaces, rather than
  porting CD's look onto the old `/admin/platform/*` screens. `/admin/platform/*` stays redirect-alive
  (§58) but is no longer the build target.
- ❗ **§13 — mounted ≠ built.** The 78 surfaces are NOT implemented. Each renders an honest placeholder
  saying so and naming the live console; **nothing fabricates data** — a placeholder never poses as an
  empty dashboard reading "you have no tenants."
- ❗ **§58 — ADDITIVE, nothing retired.** The design is a LEFT-RAIL shell; the live God console
  (`AdminLayout`) is a TOP-BAR shell. `AdminLayout` is **untouched** and `/admin/platform/*` remains the
  operator's working surface while `/operator/*` fills in per-surface. Standing checklist item answered
  explicitly: **no previously-shipped, owner-approved capability is removed, hidden, or gated off.**
- ❗ **SEQUENCING RED-LINE (held).** `OperatorLogin`'s `GOD_CONSOLE` and `resolveLandingRoute`'s operator
  branch **still point at `/admin/platform`**. Flipping them before the console is verified would 404
  both doors — the #538 lockout class. Order is **mount → verify → flip**; the flip is its own slice.
- ✅ **Open-redirect-safe deep links.** `RequireOperator` sends a signed-out operator to the door carrying
  `?next=`; `OperatorLogin` honours it via new `src/lib/auth/operatorTarget.ts` — same-origin, inside
  `/operator/`, never protocol-relative, never backslash-smuggled, never the door itself. 8 unit tests,
  mostly proving what it REFUSES. The `GOD_CONSOLE` default is unchanged.
- **Gates:** tsc 0 · **325/325** tests (14 new: 6 routing, 8 redirect-allowlist) · `lint:views` +
  `lint:definer-fns` + `lint:tier-features` clean · eslint 0 · `vite build` ✓.
- ✅ **§39 PEER-GATE ran and returned ITERATE — every finding reproduced before fixing.** Two HIGH, both
  real: **(H1) an open redirect inside the origin.** The `?next=` allowlist tested
  `/^\/operator\/[^/\\]/`, which only inspects the character AFTER `/operator/` — and `.` passes. So
  `/operator/../../book/evil-slug` was accepted and react-router **normalizes** it to `/book/evil-slug`:
  a freshly-authenticated operator landed on a tenant-authored page, on the real domain, the instant
  after typing their password. Fixed by decomposing into segments and rejecting `.` / `..` / empty; 6
  regression tests, all for what it must REFUSE. **(H2) the `?next=` round-trip was broken for the very
  tier the guard admits.** `RequireOperator` admits `is_platform_admin()` (platform_admin OR super_admin)
  but the door gated honoring `next` on `is_platform_owner()` (**super_admin only**, deliberately
  frozen) — so a platform_admin bounced off a bookmark, signed in, had `next` silently discarded, and
  fell through `resolveLandingRoute` (which has **no** platform_admin branch) to a tenant surface. The
  door now uses the guard's predicate; **this also closes the door half of the long-standing #192.**
  Three MEDIUM also fixed: **12 of the 78 leaves had no link anywhere** (nothing rendered the settings
  GROUPS while a code comment asserted the back-menu existed — CD's back-menu is now actually built);
  `/operator//fleet` rendered **blank** (a doubled slash still matches the outer splat so App's NotFound
  never fires — catch-all added); and the anti-loop check was case-sensitive while react-router is not.
  Plus three cheap LOWs: the redirect-target invariant is now locked by tests, `/operator` was added to
  `CLIENT_FORBIDDEN_PREFIXES` (a §37 producer-inventory drift), and an unknown sub-tab now redirects to
  the canonical address instead of rendering a surface its own URL contradicts.
- ✅ **§32.c PARTIAL DRIVE RAN — 10/10, real Chromium, real bundle.** §32.c's deferral is keyed to
  LACKING browser capability, and this session had one (pre-provisioned Chromium + the repo's
  Playwright), so the unauthenticated half was DRIVEN rather than deferred. New reusable script
  `scripts/live-drive/operator-console-drive.mjs` (reuses the §18 helper's Chromium resolution)
  serves the real `dist/` build and asserts, in a browser: bare `/operator` renders the login door
  (**not blank** — the failure that would have shipped undetected, since nothing links to it) ·
  `/operator/login` renders · signed-out `/operator/fleet` settles at
  `/operator/login?next=%2Foperator%2Ffleet` · the 3-level `/operator/settings/team/roles` likewise ·
  **no redirect loop** (3 mainframe navigations in 8s, settled) · `--rail` computes to
  `rgb(21, 12, 49)` rather than transparent. **Zero page crashes.** Notably the guard decided
  correctly even with Supabase unreachable — it does not hang on `loading`. **Four further
  assertions measure the CD palette in BOTH themes** (added after the CD ruling, because the
  `.dark .operator-console` block had shipped unverified — the §29 "correct in source, possibly
  shadowed at runtime" class): the light↔dark flip is **21.6:1** on the console ground
  (`rgb(252,250,248)` ↔ `rgb(12,7,18)`, so §23's "genuinely light / genuinely dark" is measured,
  not assumed) · the `.dark` override provably REACHES the palette (a shadowed block would leave
  `dark.rail === light.rail`) · rail ink clears AA on the rail in both (**11.31:1** light,
  **9.52:1** dark) · the rail reads as a distinct PANEL (**17.23:1** light, **1.46:1** dark —
  modest by nature on a ~5%L ground and leaning on the `--border-strong` edge, but well above
  CD's own ~1.0 where rail and page are identical and the rail disappears; the threshold catches
  a regression back toward that, it does not claim the dark rail is dramatic). **Recorded, NOT
  asserted:** CD's gold measures **2.41:1** on the light ground (11.27:1 dark) — under the 3:1
  non-text bar, and owner-ruled to ship as designed, so the script prints it as a NOTE rather
  than failing the build over a decision already made.
- ❗ **§32.c AUTHENTICATED HALF STILL OWED** (needs operator credentials, which this session has none
  of; the Vercel preview is behind an SSO wall): the rail RENDER itself, the 78 placeholders behind
  the guard, and the §25 taste pass. **No claim is made that the rail renders** — only that the
  door, the guard, the addressing, and the palette (both themes) resolve for real. **Measuring a
  token is not the same as seeing a layout**, and that distinction is the whole point of what is
  still owed.


### §65 R4 slice 1c — the operator console RENDERS ITS SURFACES (2026-08-18, PRs #544, #545)

- ✅ **Every one of the 78 tabs now renders a Claude Design surface**, through ONE dispatch
  (`OperatorSurface` in `OperatorApp.tsx`) — bespoke surfaces first, then the generic panel, then the
  honest stand-in. Adding a surface is a line there, never a second switch (§18).
  - **Bespoke:** `FleetConsole` (#544) · `TrustCompass` (`trust-compass/autonomy`) ·
    `KnowledgeSurface` (`paige/knowledge`) · `WorkspaceSurface` (`paige/chat`).
  - **Generic:** `OperatorPanel` + `panelSpecs` — CD builds the majority of the console from ONE panel
    driven by per-tab copy. A test asserts the registry covers `OPERATOR_BRANCHES` **exactly** (0
    missing / 0 orphaned), so a branch added later fails in CI rather than showing a blank frame.
- ✅ **The landing flip is DONE** (#544): `OperatorLogin`'s `GOD_CONSOLE` and `resolveLandingRoute`'s
  operator branch both resolve to `/operator/fleet/tenants`. (Supersedes the "still `/admin/platform`"
  line in Section 5 — corrected below.)
- ✅ **The sign-in bounce is FIXED** (#545). Root cause was NOT routing: `RequireOperator` trusted
  `useTenantContext`, which re-resolves on `SIGNED_IN` through a background load that never re-raises
  `loading` — so `{loading:false, isPlatformStaff:false}` latched from a signed-OUT page load read as a
  real denial and bounced the operator to `/admin` on every login. The guard now asks
  `is_platform_admin()` itself: context flags can only ALLOW, only the server can DENY, and silence
  never infers denial. **A second, real defect in that fix was caught by CI's tsc ratchet** —
  `supabase.rpc()` RESOLVES with `{data, error}` rather than rejecting, so the `.catch()` was dead code
  and a server-side error would have arrived as `data: null` → an unintended DENY. The error field is
  now checked explicitly. (§39 layering, working exactly as written: the peer-gate is one layer, CI is
  another, neither waives the other.)
- ✅ **Fleet reports the REAL fleet** (#545, §57). Owner-stated rule (2026-08-18): *"the real customers
  are our currently registered tenants, encapsulated inside of the shells that they belong to — the
  agency accounts with all of their sub-accounts, and the solo accounts."* So the test is **BELONGING,
  not naming**: anything inside a customer shell is a tenant of the Super Admin and stays counted,
  whatever it is called. "TENANTS on the platform" was counting three rows that belong to no shell at all
  — the platform default-set fixture, the operator workspace, and a preview agency of ours. Migration
  `20260818210000` moves those three to `revenue_class='internal_test'` — the axis that already exists
  for exactly this — guarded so a row an operator has since classified deliberately is untouched. **Every
  sub-account of the customer agency is left counted, without exception**, including the two whose names
  begin "[TEST]": they live inside the shell, so whether they are worth keeping is the owner's call on a
  console that SHOWS them, not a call a migration makes by reading their names (§13). Result: the agency
  + its 6 sub-accounts + the 2 solo shells = 9 tenants, and nothing else. The console hides internal rows from the count
  and KPIs behind a **"Show internal (n)"** chip, so no shipped row is silently removed (§58). Rows are
  ordered by **topology**: each top-level tenant, then its own sub-accounts beneath it with a hairline
  elbow (§51). The "Agencies" filter now tests `account_type IN (agency, enterprise)` instead of matching
  the substring "agency" in the plan NAME — a plan name is a label, the tier is a column.
- ❗ **§13 — what these surfaces do NOT claim.** Trust Compass derives a department's lane from the lanes
  its own action kinds actually run under (`paige_action_kinds.default_autonomy_lane`, platform rows
  only), shows the TIGHTEST lane where they disagree, and is read-only (no `onCommit`) and says so — a
  dial can only understate autonomy, never overstate a gate that is not there. Knowledge reads the
  `knowledge_base` categories that actually hold rows (that table carries no `tenant_id` at all, which is
  why it is the right corpus for a platform surface, §9); the neural field is NOT ported and the panel
  says so rather than looping a decorative animation that would read as live retrieval traffic. Workspace
  ships with an EMPTY thread and a disabled composer that states why — CD's pack contains a fully-written
  conversation (a morning brief, named departments with millisecond timings, "41 chats · 4 projects") and
  porting any of it as a literal would put words in Paige's mouth on the one surface whose job is
  reporting what she actually did.
- ✅ **§39 peer-gate ran on the real pushed diff and earned its keep** — an independent adversarial read
  that verified its claims by EXECUTING postgrest-js (network error, 401 and 404 all resolve with
  `data: null`; none reject). Six defects, all fixed in-PR:
  - **The guard, three more false-deny paths.** A verdict issued under the PREVIOUS user's token could
    land after the current user's and admit the wrong person (postgrest-js has its own `Retry-After`
    path, so an in-flight check can outlive its session) → every read now carries a generation. Stale
    context flags could hold the previous operator's `true` indefinitely after a failed background
    revalidation and outrank a real server DENY → the server now wins. And `setVerdict(null)` fired on
    EVERY auth event, so an hourly token refresh dropped all 78 routes to a skeleton, unmounting children
    and destroying in-page state → a refresh on the same user is now a no-op.
  - **The fix's own failure mode.** Staying undecided forever on an error turned a mis-deny into a
    PERMANENT skeleton with no retry and no message — §32's "silently blank", indistinguishable from a
    crash. Now: two retries with backoff, then an explicit "couldn't verify your access" with a retry.
  - **The owner-only gate — the bounce class, one layer up.** `RequireOperator` admits on its single RPC,
    which reliably beats `useTenantContext`'s five-query load, so `isPlatformOwner` was still a NOT-YET
    when `OperatorApp` read it as a NO. An owner signing in with `?next=/operator/revenue/plans` was
    redirected to Fleet — and because that redirect is `replace`, the deep link was DESTROYED, not
    delayed. Both the redirect and the rail now wait for a real answer.
  - **Three honesty defects.** The chat header appended "· every tenant, every seam" to any scope, so a
    scoped `platform_admin` — redirected out of the owner-only sections entirely — was told they had
    every seam. Knowledge counted documents by scanning rows, which PostgREST caps: a capped scan
    under-reports SILENTLY, printing a confident platform figure while the corpus holds more (counts are
    now exact + server-side, and the per-domain note is gone rather than invented, because describing
    what a domain holds needs the very scan the cap makes unreliable). And every analytics tab laid its
    single block into a two-column grid, leaving a half-width card beside an empty column.
  - **Verified clean by the same read:** the compass non-null assertion (provably guarded by its own
    filter), the tightest/mixed lane reduction (order-independent; lane `0` is never tested for
    truthiness), `ago()`'s NaN and future-date paths, hooks order, §9 scope on all three reads
    (`knowledge_base` has no `tenant_id`; `paige_action_kinds` is additionally pinned to platform rows so
    an act-as'ing operator cannot pull a tenant's overrides into the platform compass), §58 (nothing
    removed), §50 (no hits), and all 78 specs rendering.
  - **§39 honesty:** this is one LAYER. CI's tsc ratchet caught the `.catch()` defect the peer-gate
    independently confirmed — neither waives the other, exactly as §39 states.
- ❗ **§32.c AUTHENTICATED DRIVE STILL OWED.** No operator credentials in these sessions and Chromium
  cannot reach prod from the CI sandbox. The bounce fix in particular is exactly the class only a real
  login proves. **No claim is made that any of this renders for a signed-in operator** — the claim is
  that it typechecks, unit-tests, builds, and is reasoned from the real records.


### §65 R4 Stage 2 — the Fleet Console sub-tabs, wired to real reads (2026-08-19/20)

Owner-corrected order: **Systems Check ✓ → Tenants → History → Alert rules → Team Pulse.** Stage 1
made all 78 tabs *render CD's structure*; Stage 2 replaces the placeholder values inside that
structure with real, tenant-scoped reads, one sub-tab at a time.

**Sub-tab 1 — Systems Check (PR #554, merged 2026-08-19).** The operator half of Pillar 1 given its
own console surface: the pack-faithful tab above the fold, a category drill-in drawer carrying
per-check evidence, "Run full sweep" across both the operator and fleet halves, skips reported as
their own axis rather than folded into pass (§13), and the result fed into Paige's own briefing via
`owner-context.ts` (§52). The god-locked `get_systems_check_status` MCP tool ships with it.
**§32.a proven on prod; §32.c live-drive CONFIRMED by the owner** — "All is well!" across all four
checks, with screenshots. This entry closes a §0 gap: the PR merged without its Section 4 line.

**Sub-tab 2 — Tenants (PR #555).** The orbital field **rebuilt in React Three Fiber**, plus the
directory, the attention cards and Paige's read.

- **The renderer changed on an explicit owner ruling; CD's feel did not.** Claude Design ships this
  field as `fleet-field.js`, a `<fleet-field>` custom element hand-projecting a fibonacci shell onto
  a **2D canvas**. With that implementation on the table and named, the owner ruled it be rebuilt on
  R3F following the landing page's proven `PaigeScene` — which is exactly the explicit,
  names-the-thing instruction `src/operator/CLAUDE.md` requires before deviating from the pack. CD's
  drift constants, drag sensitivities, tilt clamp, tier mapping and ringed-node rule are preserved
  verbatim, and the ruling is recorded in both file headers so a later session does not "restore
  fidelity" by reverting.
- **Three real defects fixed:** the 2D field could resolve to zero height in a short column and
  simply never appear; CD sizes nodes in absolute pixels unrelated to the card, so enlarging the card
  never enlarged the node; and a WebGL throw rendered `null` with no signal at all (§32 — the
  boundary now logs loudly AND shows a visible message).
- **The pack's own duplication resolved (§18).** CD paints Tenants twice — `isFleetConsole` (L348)
  and `P.console` (L6658) are both truthy for `tab==="console"` because the panel guard at L6544 does
  not exclude it. One surface ships, with `isFleetConsole`'s geometry and `P.console`'s better-written
  strings harvested into it.
- **Two improvements PROPOSED and flagged, not slipped in**, per the owner's amendment that "the
  source of truth is reaching the best that we can": placement seeds from a hash of `tenant_id`
  rather than the array index (CD's index seeding reshuffles the whole field on every filter
  keystroke), and shell distance encodes magnitude so weight reads as gravity.
- **§13:** "Needs you today" reads real operator findings through the same `systems_check_snapshot`
  RPC the rail badge already uses, and each card's prose is Paige's OWN stored `paige_interpretation`.
  "Her read" is **templated over real values, not LLM-composed** — there is no operator-scope
  narrative endpoint on the platform (all 248 edge functions enumerated; `owner-context.ts` is a
  prompt composer consumed inside `paige-ai-chat`'s streaming path, not a callable), so the CTA hands
  the question to Paige in the chat where she lives (§20/§21). MRR and PROVISIONING render `—`.
- **§39 peer gate: THREE independent reads across two rounds.** Round 1, on the build: two
  readers, both **BLOCK**, 29 findings. The one that mattered most:
  R3F attaches its DOM listeners to the **canvas**, a descendant of the drag wrapper, so
  `setPointerCapture` there retargeted every event for that pointer and R3F's `onClick` never fired —
  clicking a tenant node did nothing at all. Also caught: sRGB values handed to three.js as float
  arrays route through the LINEAR working space, so Paige Gold `#EDB94A` painted as `#F7DD93` (the
  smoke test now proves this in both directions); the rail computed its list over filtered rows while
  its counts came from the whole fleet; **§63** — real production tenant UUIDs, one of them the
  owner's own account, sat in the smoke fixture; and **§58** — the prior rail's at-risk-tenant doors
  would have been deleted silently, so the card now carries both feeds.
- **§66:** the surface ledger in `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` was updated in the same commits, and
  four of its rows were **narrowed** after the peer gate caught them claiming more than the code does
  — a ledger row that overstates is worse than a missing one, because the next session reads it as
  verified fact.
- **Round 2 ran on the FIXES, and returned ITERATE — two blocking findings, both introduced by the
  author while closing round 1.** Recorded in full because a SHIPPED log that lists only what round 1
  caught would repeat, one paragraph later, the exact overstatement the row above was narrowed for.
  (a) The "fit the field to the smaller dimension" change was a **provable no-op**: R3F derives
  `viewport.width` as `height x (size.width/size.height)`, so `width/size.width` and
  `height/size.height` are identically equal — the `Math.min` over them could never carry aspect, and
  the measured delta across five canvas shapes was ~1e-19. Worse than the no-op, its comment claimed
  to have fixed clipping that could not occur that way, while the clipping that DOES occur (vertical,
  on a short field column, because the scale was a constant that ignored the box) went untouched and
  documented as solved. The fit now derives from the world EXTENTS, and the smoke asserts every node
  lands inside the frame across six canvas shapes — portrait, landscape, square and 4:1 both ways —
  so the claim is backed by an executable check rather than a comment. (b) The rail's `subCount`
  counted tenants that HAVE sub-accounts while its label reads "n sub-accounts beneath them", so one
  agency with six children rendered "1 sub-accounts beneath them." directly beneath a header KPI
  reading "6 sub-accounts beneath" — two numbers, one wording, one screen, no filter applied. It sums
  the children now. Also from that read: the all-clear sentence asserted "every tenant has at least
  one client" when `health()` grades a client-less tenant `warn` and therefore excludes it from the
  very filter the sentence was derived from; the drag listeners were attached by a passive effect, so
  a `pointerup` delivered before React flushed would have stranded the field mid-drag permanently;
  and the constant-drift guard added in round 1 both failed OPEN on a comment quoting an old value
  AND never ran, because `npm run test` is vitest and ignores a bare `.mjs` — it is a CI step now.
- **The layering is the lesson, not the count.** Round 1's readers were confident and thorough and
  still left work for round 2; round 2 found defects that CI, the tests, the smoke and the author's
  own review had all passed. §39 says the peer gate is one layer and none of them is sufficient
  alone — this slice is the worked example.
- ❗ **§32.c live-drive OWED.** Nothing here has been rendered. A green build and a headless smoke
  prove the maths does not throw and the colours do not mangle; neither says what appears on screen —
  which is the exact failure mode this rebuild exists to fix.

**Deliberately NOT folded in:** Paige at the orbit core (`paige-bot.glb`). A 6.5MB asset on the
`useGLTF` path is one of the three operations that has thrown at load in this codebase before, so it
gets its own slice with its own smoke test rather than a quiet addition (§32).


### Roles & permissions — R1 call-site inventory + R2a platform-seam fix (2026-08-18)

- ✅ **R1 — every role call site classified** (`docs/audits/R1-role-call-site-inventory.md`).
  Deterministic SQL over prod bucketed **all 186 RLS policies** (operator-intent 3 · tenant-filtered 3
  · **no-tenant-predicate 82** · **OR-composition 98**) and **all 118 role-referencing functions**
  (operator-intent 10 · **no-tenant-scope 31** · mixed 69 · other 8). Totals reconcile exactly.
  **117 of 118 functions are `SECURITY DEFINER`** — RLS bypassed, so the in-body check is the only
  guard (§59). **No behaviour change in R1 itself.**
- ✅ **The amplifier, measured:** `map_tenant_role_to_app_role()` maps tenant `owner` AND `admin` →
  global `admin`, and the ENABLED trigger `trg_sync_tenant_member_to_user_roles` writes it into the
  tenant-less `user_roles`. **9 `admin` holders across 10 of 13 tenants vs 1 `super_admin`** — so
  "global admin" is approximately "every tenant owner." Read every `has_role(uid,'admin')` guard
  that way.
- ✅ **R2a — `paige_workflow_registry` platform seam closed** (migration
  `20260919000000_workflow_registry_platform_seam.sql`). All 23 rows are `tenant_id IS NULL`, so
  `has_role('admin') AND (tenant_id IS NULL OR tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id())` collapsed to
  `has_role('admin')` on a PERMISSIVE **cmd=ALL** policy — any tenant owner could rewrite
  `requires_approval` / `direct_function_name`. Platform rows now require `is_platform_operator()`;
  tenant-owned rows keep tenant-admin access (§58: the access reduction is explicit, and the `admin`
  role stays meaningful). `platform_set_workflow_webhook_url` + `admin_get_workflow_webhook_url` →
  operator-gated, `anon`/`PUBLIC` EXECUTE revoked. **§37: both functions had ZERO producers.**
- ✅ **A broken function removed:** `admin_get_workflow_webhook_url(uuid)` selected a column
  `n8n_webhook_url` that does not exist (table has `n8n_webhook_url_ct`) — threw `42703` on every
  call, zero callers. Found *by the §32.a rollback proof refusing to recreate it*, and dropped.


**§13 discipline:** every ✅ here has file/migration/PR evidence in the audit at `outputs/systems-inventory-2026-08-09` (Cowork's inventory work of 2026-08-09). If you're about to say "we don't have X," check this section first. **CC's code check is authoritative** — if your grep disagrees with this section, log a §13 correction in Section 10 and update Section 4 in the same PR.

### Cowork research discipline (owner-locked 2026-08-09, HARD RULE — mechanical, not aspirational)

**Cowork's sandbox is a mount of the owner's local filesystem — often on a stale branch behind main.** Every claim Cowork makes about a file, table, function, or component MUST be grounded in a GitHub API result against `ref: main` (or a named branch), NOT in a sandbox grep. Historical §13 misses (`_shared/tts-router.ts`, `paige_owner_memory`, `ContactCommsPanel.tsx` path, `ClientsConversations.tsx` line count, `Admin.tsx:322` mount claim) all traced to sandbox grep on stale branches — every one was CC-caught when they ran the same check against fresh-cloned main.

**The mechanical rule (Cowork binds to this — CC and Codex apply the same principle to their own environments):**

- **Reads:** Cowork uses `mcp__github__search_code` + `mcp__github__get_file_contents` with `ref: "main"` (or a named branch). NEVER sandbox `Grep`/`Glob`/`Read` for asserting platform code state.
- **Writes:** Cowork uses `mcp__github__push_files` or `create_or_update_file` to push directly to GitHub — BUT the current MCP token is read-only (verified 2026-08-09 with a `create_or_update_file` returning `403 Resource not accessible by integration`). Cowork writes therefore MUST hand off to CC or Codex, who have real write access. Cowork producing a paste with the exact content + target file + insertion point is the correct handoff pattern.
- **Sandbox tools (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Write`/`Edit`):** reserved for the outputs folder (Cowork's paste files for the owner). NEVER for asserting platform code state.
- **Every claim cites its source:** file path + branch/ref + line number (or migration version + PR #). Format examples: `docs/foo.md@main:L42` or `migration 20260810120000 (PR #406)` or `src/pages/foo.tsx@main SHA:abc123`. Missing citation = missing claim; retract or add the citation before shipping.
- **When CC's code check contradicts Cowork:** CC wins automatically. No arguing "but my grep said." Log the §13 correction in Section 10 with the CC-verified reality, mark Cowork's original claim as REVERSED.

**Why this exists (this doc's own §13 misses #8, #10, #11, #12):** Cowork keeps drifting to sandbox tools because they're faster (no API roundtrip, no rate limits). But when the sandbox is on a stale branch, "faster" produces WRONG answers that Cowork writes into this master doc as ground truth. Fresh-clone CC catches every miss. The fix is not aspiration — it's mechanical tool discipline codified here so every session sees it and Cowork cannot drift without producing a visible citation failure the owner can call out.

**Owner self-check (how to catch a Cowork drift instantly):** if Cowork asserts a file path, table name, or line number without a `ref: main` citation next to it, that's the failure signal. Ask "what SHA?" — if Cowork can't answer with a real commit hash, the claim is provisional and CC's next code check is authoritative.

### Communications — SHIPPED (CC-verified on main, 2026-08-09)

The rich two-way client inbox is fully shipped and mounted (this REPLACES an earlier Cowork entry with wrong paths — see §13 corrections #10/#11):
- **Rich inbox UI:** `src/pages/admin/ClientsConversations.tsx` — a full **1,927-line** three-column Conversations surface (the UI in the owner's screenshot), mounted at `/admin/clients-hub/conversations` via **`Admin.tsx:396-398`** (`<Route path="conversations">` → `ConversationsTabsLayout` → `ClientsConversations`). **No routing gap, no placeholder.**
- **Conversation components:** live under **`src/pages/admin/conversations/`** (`ComposeThreadDialog`, `ConversationsSubPages`, `ConversationsSettings`, `inbox-shared.ts`) — NOT `src/components/admin/contacts/`. `ContactCommsPanel.tsx` does not exist.
- **Notification-log surface (separate):** `src/pages/admin/CommunicationsAdmin.tsx` (272 lines) reads `communication_log`/`communication_preferences` — a DIFFERENT surface from the inbox; do not conflate.
- **Backend:** `public.messages` (jsonb substrate) + `public.threads` (aggregate) + `send-message` edge fn; `usePaigeThreads.ts` hook.
- **Operator (God) SMS:** `paige-operator-sms-send` edge fn (from PR #408) — see the Fleet Comms 500 gap in Section 5.
- Doctrine: §7 intelligent portal · §36 draft-first/one-click · §49 unified inline-single-conversation.
- **A2P registration — PREPARED is shipped; SUBMITTED is not (PR #665, 2026-08-30).** Preparing a
  carrier registration now DURABLY SAVES: `comms-a2p-draft` previously did two reads and no write, so
  the prepared draft died with the HTTP response. It persists through
  `tenant_a2p_registration_save_draft` (migration `20261004010000`) into the existing
  `tenant_a2p_registrations`. **Corrected 2026-08-30 (PR #672):** the first version of this
  entry read "no new table, column, or parallel store". That was true of #665 and is no
  longer true — #672 adds three nullable columns (`optin_message`, `optout_message`,
  `help_message`) because the draft generates seven reviewed fields and only four had a
  home, so three carrier-facing compliance replies were silently dropped. The save seam is
  now the 8-argument `tenant_a2p_registration_save_draft`; the 5-argument signature is
  DROPPED so no caller can reach the version that loses them. Absent preserves a field,
  an EMPTY STRING clears it — an owner must be able to delete a wrong STOP or HELP reply. `campaign_description` is the ONE exception and PRESERVES on empty; the flat rule was stated without it, which is exactly the sentence a later session would answer “how does the merge work?” from. **Carrier submission does not
  exist:** `comms-a2p-submit` performs no provider call and returns an explicit *prepared, not
  submitted* refusal, and no shipped path sets `submitted_at`. Do not read a `pending` row as a
  filing. Preparing requires `tenant_legal_profile.legal_business_name`, which **0 of 13 production
  tenants** currently have, so refusal is the first-use path for every tenant today.

- **The business phone line — SHIPPED and Paige-callable (PRs #692, #695, #699; live 2026-09-01).**
  A Solo tenant can search available numbers (area code, region, city, starts-with, toll-free),
  buy one into their **own** Twilio subaccount, name it, clear the name, and choose **which number
  the business calls and texts from** — the last of those being a control that did not previously
  exist anywhere. Seams: `comms-search-numbers` / `comms-purchase-number` (edge) and
  `tenant_phone_number_rename` / `tenant_phone_number_set_primary` (RPC, SECURITY DEFINER,
  caller scope re-enforced in-body per §59). Surface: Settings → Connections → Communications.
  - **Paige can drive the PHONE half.** Eight `comms_*` tools in `paige-ai-chat` cover the safe
    connection summary, listing, search, buy, rename, set-primary, registration status and
    registration draft. Four mutate and carry catalogue rows under a new **`Comms`** category, so
    each defaults to `confirm` and the operator can switch it off: `comms_buy_number`,
    `comms_set_primary_number`, `comms_name_number`, `comms_draft_registration`.
  - **What Paige CANNOT drive, stated so "Paige-callable comms" is not read as the whole surface:**
    the custom sending domains and the Google sending account. Both are operable by a person on
    that surface and neither has a Paige tool. That half is click-only.
  - **Money safety.** `comms_buy_number` requires the quoted `monthly_cents`, the confirmation
    sentence names the dollar figure, and `comms-purchase-number` re-checks it against
    `platform_number_pricing` **before** buying — refusing on mismatch (`price_changed`) or when it
    cannot be verified (`price_unverifiable`). Unverifiable is a refusal: absence of a price is not
    permission to spend. A malformed quote is refused **ahead of the autonomy gate**, so `auto`
    cannot route around it. Every exit that follows a real charge — there are **four** — writes an
    `audit_logs` row (`comms:number_purchased`), the charged-but-unrecorded ones carrying
    `recorded_on_tenant: false`.
  - **HONEST LIMITS.** Filing with a carrier still does not exist (see the A2P entry above).
    Releasing a number is deliberately not built — `status='released'` has no writer, and setting it
    without the provider call would mark a number released while the provider kept billing. The
    Trust Compass ceiling clamps these tools at RENDER only; `resolve_tool_autonomy`, which the
    runtime consults, does not read the compass, so the per-tool floor is the enforcement today.
    An operator acting as a tenant cannot reach the two new RPCs through Paige (the executor passes
    `_id` alone) — a refusal, not a leak.

### Agent Presence primitive family — SHIPPED (CC-verified on main SHA `580b13f4`, byte sizes byte-matched 2026-08-09)

The ⌘K launcher + right-side Paige presence rail chrome is a reusable primitive family, live on the Fleet Console (owner screenshot 2026-08-09). This entry closes a Cowork completeness gap — the Agent UI Placement spec defined this surface but Section 4 hadn't marked it shipped. (Verified by CC against `origin/main`: all 7 files exist and every byte size matches; folded as its own docs PR since the miss #21 PR (#417) had already merged.)

- **Primitive family** — `src/components/ui/paige/` (CC `git cat-file -s` sizes):
  - `AgentPresence.tsx` (3,631 B) — the presence primitive
  - `AgentPresenceContext.tsx` (7,715 B) — React context; resolves persona by `account_type` (super_admin → Paige Operator · agency → Paige Agency · tenant → Paige)
  - `AgentRail.tsx` (12,530 B) — the right-side presence rail (persona pill + empty state "Your Paige team is on call" + account-type-aware description + "Ask from anywhere ⌘K" trigger)
  - `CommandLauncher.tsx` (5,612 B) — the ⌘K modal (persona-aware placeholder)
  - `persona.ts` (3,535 B) — persona resolution logic
  - `index.ts` (1,630 B) — barrel export
  - `AgentPresence.test.tsx` (10,522 B) — test coverage
- **Doctrine hooks:** §7 intelligent portal · §14 Paige-runs-a-team ("your Paige team is on call") · §20 dispatch-in-chat (⌘K opens a Paige chat surface anywhere) · §36 intuitiveness moat (5-minute discoverability via ⌘K) · §11 primitive-layer discipline · §9 tenant/operator seam (persona swaps clean per `account_type`).
- **Intelligence layer NOT live (§13 baked into the copy):** the placeholder literally reads *"{persona}'s live conversation connects here soon — your message isn't sent yet."* The chrome is shipped; the send/receive/reasoning wiring is Wave 4 MVP-hub work — the correct shipped-chrome / not-yet-intelligence pattern (§32).
- **Spec:** `docs/product/agent-ui-placement-spec.md` (§5a persona surface + ⌘K launcher + right-rail placement).
- **Evidence:** owner screenshot 2026-08-09 of `paigeagent.ai/admin/platform/tenants` (rail + ⌘K modal); CC file/size verification against `origin/main`.

### Integration Capability Registry — the provider-governance delivery contract (2026-09-06)

- ✅ **`docs/integration-registry/` shipped** — the one authoritative, living catalogue + taxonomy of
  every third-party provider, API, connector, Marketplace service, and external-execution platform
  Paige may use, with per-provider governance (business reason · Paige use cases · connection
  prerequisite · required scopes · safe readable context · allowed writes/effects · authority lane ·
  M1 dependency · canonical provider receipt · Rail/Mind/Memory boundary · status · owner · dependency
  · next slice · tier eligibility). Machine-readable `integration-capability-registry.json` is the
  source of truth; `README.md` is the human companion. Six-word status vocabulary: **LIVE · PARTIAL ·
  PROPOSED · UNAVAILABLE · DEFERRED · PROOF OWED**.
  - **This is a product-governance and delivery record, not a provider-integration build** — it
    installs nothing, holds no credentials, calls no external API, creates no OAuth client.
  - **Cardinal rule:** a registry listing NEVER means a provider is connected, available, or
    autonomous (R1). Marketplace entries are **global capability metadata only** — never tenant
    credentials/usage/private client material/purchases/billing (R4). Native Google Workspace / M365
    creation requires that tenant's explicit connected-provider authorization (R5).
  - **Delivery rule (MANDATORY):** read the entry before proposing/implementing/opening a PR
    for/changing a provider integration; update it before merge with the actual capability/authority/
    proof/limits/next owner, same commit (§0/§66/§BRAIN.3).
  - **Enforced by** the structural guard `scripts/ci/integration-registry-lint.mjs`
    (`npm run lint:integration-registry` + `:test`, wired into `ci.yml`) — a concise clone of
    `lint:binding-ledger` that fails CI on missing fields, unknown status/lane/tier vocabulary,
    duplicate ids, an unbuilt status declaring a real acting lane, a LIVE entry with no provable
    receipt, a Marketplace entry leaking per-tenant data, or an uncovered taxonomy group.
  - **v1.1 — API Expense & Operations Layer (2026-09-06):** every provider (and every Public Presence
    roadmap item) carries an `expense_and_operations` block — cost responsibility (platform_paid/
    tenant_direct/shared/pass_through/undecided) · billing + operational owner · pricing model + OFFICIAL
    source URL + checked-as-of date · cost driver · rate limits · usage-review cadence · renewal/
    deprecation review · data/privacy/retention · money-movement + M1 dependency · receipt/reconciliation/
    Rail/pause-revoke · next owner/slice. Derived 4-section view:
    `docs/integration-registry/expense-and-operations-report.md` (current platform operating
    dependencies · tenant-authorized integrations · future Agency/Enterprise · Public Presence roadmap
    GSC→GBP→Bing→Apple→Yelp→FB/LinkedIn→directories). **"M1" is disambiguated (owner ruling 2026-09-06):**
    `cost_tracks` names **internal LLM-cost metering** (operating-cost visibility, §8.4) vs **M1
    real-money spend control** (external spend backbone, §10). Any provider that can create purchases/
    payments/ad-spend/bookkeeping/obligations points to the real-money track — the guard fails CI
    otherwise, and rejects an unqualified "M1". §13 honesty: prices are NOT verified this slice
    (checked-as-of null + source URL recorded); no price invented, no free plan assumed, custom/
    enterprise recorded honestly. Provider API fees are separate from customer money movement; Paige is
    never merchant of record (§38). The correction is go-forward only — historical closeouts are NOT
    rewritten (§58).
  - **v1.2 — code_anchors accountability (2026-09-13, docs + CI-guard only):** a new `field_schema.code_anchors`
    contract makes every runtime-claiming provider (LIVE/PARTIAL/PROOF_OWED) cite the REAL adapter/entry-point
    code that backs it ({path, role, note?}); unbuilt providers (UNAVAILABLE/DEFERRED/PROPOSED) stay unanchored.
    Backfilled on all 16 runtime-claiming providers (50 anchors, each verified to exist on disk), with two §13
    escalations preserved in-anchor — **meta** is contained to HTTP 503 (all four anchors `fail_closed_containment`,
    NOT LIVE) and **google-workspace** has only Calendar OAuth, no Drive/Docs adapter. `role` is a controlled,
    lint-enforced vocabulary (`provider_adapter`/`callback_readback`/`fail_closed_containment`/`proven_runtime`);
    a code anchor proves a code PATH EXISTS, never that a provider works/connected/LIVE, and it raised NO status.
    The guard `scripts/ci/integration-registry-lint.mjs` gained a pure `findDeadCodeAnchors` dead-anchor resolve
    (fails CI on a cited path missing from disk) reusing the binding-ledger's `findDeadAnchors` pattern (§18 — no
    new lint/npm-script/CI-step). Closes the mechanism gap the registry's `registry_steward_role` named (Upload-Post
    / fal.ai merged owing entries); a reverse coupling check (a provider DIFF must update its entry) remains a
    tracked follow-up. Schema bumped 1.1.0 -> 1.2.0.
  - **§13 grounding note:** the brief named a *"Marketplace Brain decision"* that has **no artifact
    under that phrase repo-wide** — the Marketplace rule is grounded on `MARKETPLACE-DATA-MODEL.md`
    instead; recorded as unresolved, not invented.
  - **Known pre-existing dependencies (found at the registry-build closeout sweep, 2026-09-06):** the RE-2
    M1-a money backbone, the Solo Tenant Brain Business Mission slice, and the Public Presence slice each
    declared an *"Integration Capability Registry dependency"* and referenced a **"Registry Steward"** role
    BEFORE this registry existed. The registry ARTIFACT is now their home, but two things remain **owed** and
    are honestly NOT yet delivered (§13 — the artifact existing does not by itself unblock a slice's provider
    action): (1) the **specific per-provider entries** those slices spec'd — RE-2 M1-a's *"record-provider-
    confirmed-spend + reconcile"* backbone and a **Public Presence** provider entry (the `meta` entry is a
    candidate home, not a substitute; a dedicated entry may be needed) — seeded into the registry JSON's
    `known_owed_entries`; and (2) the **"Registry Steward" role** those slices reference is undefined here
    (the registry ships a per-entry `owner` field + the delivery rule instead — an owner decision on whether
    that satisfies the Steward requirement is owed). **The dated dependency notes below stay accurate and are
    NOT rewritten (§58):** the Public Presence note (~L4198) says no Public-Presence-specific *entry* or
    Steward record exists — that remains TRUE (only a placeholder is seeded), so it is a still-valid provider
    blocker, not a stale claim. The Solo Tenant Brain Business Mission dependency was on delivery
    INFRASTRUCTURE (the Supabase deploy path), already covered by `excluded_delivery_infrastructure` +
    `config-registry.md`; its slice said "do not invent an entry," so no owed provider entry is recorded for
    it (cross-link only, never a duplicate infra entry). Authoring the owed entries + settling the Steward
    role is a **tracked follow-up** (parked, per "park unrelated provider findings, don't expand into
    individual integrations").

### Third-party integrations WIRED + CONFIGURED

- ✅ **Twilio — ISV/reseller architecture LIVE at Twilio's side; number search and purchase SHIPPED (2026-09-01).**
  - **Organization:** Paige Agent AI LLC (⚠ vendor/Twilio Org name — pending rename to Paige Agent AI Inc. per 2026-08-11 C-Corp conversion, owner-owed vendor update) · Org SID `<redacted — owner's Twilio console>` · verified domain paigeagent.ai · 1 managed user (Antonio Cook, info@paigeagent.ai) · 1 billing group
  - **Corporate identity (D7, SHIPPED 2026-08-11):** the legal entity is **Paige Agent AI Inc.** — a **standalone Delaware C-Corp** (direct conversion from Paige Agent AI LLC, Option A per owner ruling). No holdco, no parent. Present-tense entity name swept platform-wide (`_shared/platform-identity.ts` `legal_entity_name`, Terms/Privacy/Footer/Pricing public pages → "Paige Agent AI Inc.", Delaware corporation). Stale CoreConnect-subsidiary language + the Portfolio-mode-as-corporate-structure C-suite doctrine **DELETED** from `paige-c-suite-roster.md` (now two-scope: tenant + operator); `PORTFOLIO_SCOPE_BRIEFING.md` marked SUPERSEDED. New living doctrine: `docs/doctrine/paige-corporate-structure.md` (PROPOSED). "Portfolio" is now ONLY a future marketplace feature (task #129). **Owner-owed (task #128):** vendor renames (Twilio/Stripe/DocuSign/WHOIS) + binding-legal-doc migration + banking + the Aedis Brands LLC / Givalli Heritage Holdings Inc. brand-license decision (public Footer — preserved + flagged, not part of the CoreConnect ruling).
  - **Master account:** `<redacted — owner's Twilio console>` (owned by Antonio Cook, created 04/21/2026, Active)
  - **Subaccounts (5 active, provisioned manually via Twilio console, naming convention `Paige – <Tenant Name>`; SIDs in owner's console):**
    - Paige – Antonio Daniel LLC
    - Paige – Claude Studio Dev ⚠ tenant being deleted in #29 — subaccount will orphan at Twilio (owner cleanup at Twilio console)
    - Paige – First Sterling Capital
    - Paige – Mogul Maker Academy
    - Paige – Project Mogul Enterprise Inc
  - **Envs currently in code (NAMES only):** `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` · `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` · `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` · `TWILIO_FROM` — MASTER account creds.
  - **Purchase capability EXISTS** — that's how subaccounts have numbers assigned today.
  - **Number search + purchase SHIPPED (PRs #692/#695/#699, live 2026-09-01).** This line previously
    read *"Only remaining gap: phone-number SEARCH tools inside the Communications console"* and was
    left standing when the capability shipped, so this document asserted both states at once — the
    exact contradiction a source of truth exists to prevent. Corrected here rather than deleted, so
    the drift is visible (§13).
    **What a shipped caller can actually search on today:** area code · region (state) · city
    (locality) · a DIGIT prefix (`starts_with`, converted to a Twilio `Contains` pattern with the
    area code folded in) · toll-free vs local. Results carry the live retail price from
    `platform_number_pricing`.
    **What the EDGE FUNCTION accepts but no shipped caller sends** — same status, so listed the same
    way: letter-based **vanity** matching (`starts_with` is stripped to digits, and neither the
    Connections UI nor `comms_search_numbers` exposes a raw `contains`) and **`sms_enabled`**
    capability filtering (headless-only; `NumbersTab.tsx` says so in a comment, `useSoloNumbers`
    does not send it, and the tool schema has no such property). An earlier draft of this bullet
    listed SMS filtering as shipped while calling vanity unreachable, on identical evidence — the
    test for "shipped" is whether a product caller can reach it, applied to every filter or to none.
    **Premium / registry search** is not built at all. Task #27's remaining scope is vanity and
    premium/registry; exposing `sms_enabled` through a caller is a separate, smaller question.
- ✅ **Stripe** — live-mode webhook + checkout + Marketplace + Connect wiring started. Functions: `stripe-webhook`, `create-checkout`, `create-trial-checkout`, `customer-portal`, `check-subscription`, `marketplace-checkout-session`, `tenant-checkout-session`, `tenant-stripe-connect`. B-iv storefront webhook merged (PR `9f9b6cf7`). B-ii-a marketplace paid install merged (PR `c95a7e16`). Data: `platform_subscriptions` table.
- **ElevenLabs voice I/O — `PROOF OWED`.** Paige-owned message playback and Live Conversation resolve
  only through the approved server-side Paige Voice Profile. No hosted provider agent owns reasoning,
  context, authority, memory, tools, records, or actions. Realtime transport remains disabled until
  account scopes, voice authorization, retention/ZRM application, quota, concurrency, and Paige's
  calendar-month hard cost limit plus conservative per-character price ceiling are independently
  verified. The service-only control plane rechecks canonical proof and atomically reserves uncached
  TTS cost before any provider call; ambiguous provider outcomes stay counted, actor deletion cannot
  erase spend, and activation commits readiness plus profile atomically. Revocation or an exceeded
  cap fails closed. No provider or voice reference appears in customer UI.
- ✅ **Supabase** — Postgres + RLS + edge functions + auth. Prod ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`. 231+ edge functions. 688+ migrations. RLS helpers: `is_platform_owner()` (operator scope), `current_user_tenant_id()` (tenant scope).
- ✅ **Vercel** — deploy target. `vercel.json` at repo root.
- ✅ **LLM providers via `_shared/model-router.ts`** — text tier: Anthropic + Featherless. Capability tier: OpenAI + Gemini + Groq + Ideogram + Replicate + Meshy + ElevenLabs.
- ✅ **Voyage embeddings** — `_shared/voyage.ts`. Model `voyage-3` @ 1024 dims.
- ✅ **Meta** (FB + IG), **Google** (Calendar OAuth + Drive), **Zoom**, **QuickBooks**, **Plaid** (+ Paige-Plaid variants), **DocuSign**, **Cal.com**, **Resend**, **iSoftpull · SmartCredit · Nav · Apollo · Firecrawl · PostHog · Sentry · Zapier MCP · n8n · Telegram · VAPID web push · Browserbase · D&B · LexisNexis · OpenCorporates · FRED · TransUnion Business**
- ❌ **HubSpot · Vapi · Microsoft/Outlook OAuth** — NOT wired

### Platform capabilities SHIPPED

- ✅ **Slice 1c IA restructure — COMPLETE (2026-07-25)**, 8-item nav shipped.
- ✅ **8-item top nav:** Paige · Command Center · Marketplace · Clients · Team · Growth · Analytics · Setup
- ✅ **Marketplace** (Slice 1c-xii, task #440). PR #213.
- ✅ **Analytics primitive** (Slice 1c-x). Migration `20260722203249_analytics_rpc_operator_gate_1c_x_0.sql`. PR #202.
- ✅ **Signup completion gate** — migrations `20260714013653` + `20260714015706`.
- ✅ **Action bus** (§8) — `20260711024632_action_bus.sql` + drainer on */2 cron.
- ✅ **§16 10-department org model** — `paige_departments` via `20260713120000_org_blueprint_departments.sql`.
- ✅ **§34-L1 metering — Paige's spend is now BILLABLE usage, not just observable** (MET1, branch `codex/paige-knowledge-active-tenant-isolation-v2`, **NOT MERGED — draft PR, Gate 2 not requested**). `meter_llm_usage(p_limit)` drains `paige_llm_trace` into `platform_usage_events` as `llm_tokens` rows (service-role only, idempotent via a partial unique index on `metadata->>'trace_id'`). **The state it corrects, measured on prod 2026-09-01:** 663 traces, 15,578,931 tokens spent on tenants' behalf, and **zero LLM usage records had ever been written** — the cost half of §67 autonomy, unmetered. **The finding underneath it:** 197 of 228 meterable traces (86%, and 99.3% of tokens) carried NO cost, because the direct `_shared/claude.ts` path traced usage and never priced it while `model-router` did; the platform's `$1.38` estimate covered 0.7% of its tokens. Fixed at the writer (`_shared/token-pricing.ts`, the one home — `claude.ts` cannot import the router without a cycle, which is why THREE copies of the price table had accumulated), and priced per MODEL for anthropic so haiku is no longer valued at ~3× list. Historical rows are NOT back-priced (§13 — that would be invention); they meter tokens and carry an explicit null cost. **Recording usage is not charging for it:** no price book, no invoice, no `reconciled_invoice_id`, and no consumer surface yet. Evidence: `scripts/sql/meter-llm-usage-proof.sql` 12/12 on prod with two controls, mutation-tested; `test:token-pricing` 20/20 + `test:trace-wiring` 12/12, both in CI, 14 mutations all caught. **§32.a persisted-apply and §32.c live drive both OWED.**
- ✅ **§34 Intelligence spine** (partial): `paige_prompt_template` · `paige_prompt_memory` · `paige_llm_trace` · `paige_eval` · `paige_subagents_talent` · `paige_action_bus_drainer` · `paige_action_worker_cron` · `studio_visual_critique_log`. Prompt-forge at `_shared/prompt-forge.ts`; visual-critique gate at `_shared/visual-critique-gate.ts`.
- ✅ **`paige_owner_memory` table** — migration `20260810120000`, shipped in PR #406. L6/L8 memory table, distinct from `paige_prompt_memory`.
- ✅ **Voice = Ivanna** (ConvAI agent live post 2026-08-08 hotfix; in-app chat voice via `_shared/tts-router.ts` `DEFAULT_TTS_VOICE`)
- ✅ **§60 structural tier-lock** (#122 + #125 + Enterprise hybrid #460, 2026-08-11) — `src/lib/tier/tierFeatures.ts` is the ONE HOME for tier→feature mapping (`hasFeature`/`useTierFeatures`), guarded by CI `lint:tier-features`. Current owner-locked rule: **`customer_portal_invite` = Solo + Sub-account + Enterprise**; Agency + Super Admin excluded. **Growth + Vibe Studio = Solo/Sub/Enterprise/God, NOT Agency** (route-gated via `RequireFeature`). Tier baselines in `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md`.
- ✅ **Money Spine Lane B-ii-a + B-iv** merged.
- ✅ **§27 facelift sweep** (PR `a2df4436`)
- ✅ **§37 amendment** (PR #232)
- ✅ **§38 money boundary doctrine** (PR #230)
- ✅ **Chat compaction substrate** (BRD §174-176) — in `paige-ai-chat/index.ts`.

### Merged 2026-08-09 (this batch)

- ✅ **#412 — Tenant revenue classification + $0-ARR honesty** (PR #412, merged 2026-08-09). `tenant_revenue_classification` (paid/promotional/internal_test, operator-only) + topology corrections + hard-delete-cascade of 2 retired tenants (Paige Operations + Claude Studio Dev) + Platform Defaults relocation + Part-5 tenant-switcher nesting + `operator_dashboard_metrics` reconciliation to real revenue + `paige-mcp` revenue-class splits. **§32.a persisted-apply GREEN on prod** — `schema_migrations` advanced, 11→9 tenants, 4 PME sub-accounts, 0 paid-class → Fleet Console reconciled to the honest **$0 ARR**.
- ✅ **#413 — Master project reference + §0 session-start rule** (PR #413, merged 2026-08-09). THIS doc, established as the single source of truth; `CLAUDE.md §0` (read the master doc at session start / major builds / "do we have X?" checks).
- ✅ **#410 — Second Brain** (`docs/brain/`, PR #410, merged 2026-08-09) + §BRAIN discipline (proposed). README index + `config-registry.md` + `decision-log.md` + `lessons-learned.md` + `glossary.md` + `codebase-map.md` — a verified, read-before-work knowledge base so sessions stop re-diagnosing documented systems.

### Merged 2026-08-10 (this batch)

- ✅ **#31 — Revenue Integrity Chain** (PR #415, merged 2026-08-09/10) + CSV always-export polish (PR #421). Fail-closed `enforce_revenue_integrity_chain` trigger + `operator_revenue_integrity_audit()` RPC + Fleet Console audit UI. **§32.a persisted-apply + live-prod block-test GREEN** — Wave 8 revenue launch-gate cleared. Current prod: promotional 8 / internal_test 1 / **paid 0** ($0 ARR, honest).
- ✅ **§52 — Paige operator runtime-context substrate (Phase 1, Super-Admin)** (PR #424, merged 2026-08-10). Fix for the 2026-08-09 §36 catastrophic miss (Super-Admin Paige asked the founder who he was). Migration `20260816120000` (relax `paige_owner_memory.tenant_id`→NULLABLE for the tenant-less God account + `is_platform_owner()` own_* policy branches + 7 PII-free operator seed rows) · `_shared/owner-context.ts` composer (service-role read by verified user_id, real platform-state queries with honest fallbacks, compiled doctrine/master constants, by-name greeting from runtime auth metadata not the repo) · `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` injection at `aiMessages[2]`, dual-gated on tenant-less persona AND `is_platform_operator()`. **§32.a persisted-apply GREEN on prod.** `CLAUDE.md §52`. **OWED: owner §32.c live-drive** (`/admin/playbook` → Paige greets by name, never asks identity). Phase 2 (agency/tenant/sub/client personas + cross-persona identity link) = separate slice.
- ✅ **§53 — operator role tiers + grant lockdown** (PR #424, merged 2026-08-10). Migration `20260816130000`: `is_platform_operator()` = super_admin OR platform_admin (NEW; `is_platform_owner()` FROZEN super_admin-only) + structural `user_roles` `trg_enforce_protected_role_grant` trigger locking super_admin/platform_admin grants to an existing super_admin or a trusted service context. **Closed a real §9 escalation** (`grant_tenant_member_role` let a tenant admin mint `platform_admin`). §32.b proven; §32.a GREEN on prod. `CLAUDE.md §53`. Fast-follows: #89 `/admin/team` tier-leak, #90 taxonomy-doc, deferred anon/authenticated DML REVOKE.
- ✅ **Systems Check MVP — Layer 1** (Owner Trilogy Pillar 1, task #80, PR #423, merged 2026-08-10). Migration `20260816000000`: 4 tables (`paige_systems_check_registry`/`_run`/`_finding`/`_baseline`, all FORCE RLS) + the 10 MVP-locked checks seeded (owner rulings: #3 capture-only, #4 external-detect-only, #10 Stripe-native read). **§32.b + §51 proven; §32.a GREEN on prod** (4 tables + 10-check seed persisted). Runner edge fns + orchestrator + surface = later layers.
- ✅ **Systems Check MVP — Layer 2 (the Runner)** (Owner Trilogy Pillar 1, task #80, PR #427, merged 2026-08-10). Runner core `_shared/systems-check-runner.ts` + 10 runner modules + 3 flavor edge fns (`systems-check-run-{onboarding,scheduled,change}`) + migration `20260816140000` (§38 processor-agnostic capture cols `tenants.payment_processor_declared`/`payment_methods_declared`; registry #10 flipped off the Stripe-native read; `systems.remediate` action-kind) + `20260816150000` (daily scheduled cron). **§32.a GREEN on prod** (both migrations persisted). **§32.c CONFIRMED headless-drive 2026-08-10** — Mogul Maker Academy (`d8a0a880…`) scan via the scheduled fn's internal single-tenant path (same core/runners/writes/filing): run row `check_count=10`, **1 pass / 5 fail / 1 skip / 3 error**, a `systems.remediate` action filed for every fail at `autonomy_lane='confirm'` routed to the owning §16 dept (finance/sales/marketing/tech), payment remediation copy §38-clean. **Two fast-follows the drive surfaced (§13):** (a) PR #429 — `service_role` had no grant on the 4 `paige_systems_check_*` tables + `tenant_workflows`/`tenant_mcp_connections`/`tenant_email_identities` (runtime `permission denied` the §32.b rollback proofs couldn't catch — they run as owner, not service_role; grants applied + proven, migration `20260816160000`); (b) task #95 — 3 runner column-name bugs (`tenant_email_identities.id`, `tenants.website` don't exist) still `error` fail-loud, runner-code fix pending. Runner is **fail-loud + honest** (real error class recorded, never a fabricated pass). Surface (L3) + operator-scope catalog = task #93.
- ✅ **Systems Check MVP — Layer 3 (tile + Command Center + Wave-S3 operator catalog)** (Owner Trilogy Pillar 1, task #93, PR #430, merged 2026-08-10). **Pillar #1 now fully live — schema + runner + surface, tenant AND operator.** Adds a "Command Center" tab to the Super Admin nav (`GOD_HUBS`/`GOD_STAFF_HUBS`, §35 universal-surface gap closed) pointing at the EXISTING `/admin` operator index — **§18: extends `OperatorCommandCenter`, does NOT fork a `PlatformCommandCenter`** (the operator CC already existed with a reserved findings slot). Shared `SystemsCheckTile` (`src/components/systems-check/`, composes the `ui/page` kit) dropped into BOTH the operator CC (`scope='operator'`) and the tenant CC/`PracticeOverview` (`scope='tenant'`) via the one `useSystemsCheck` seam; §36 one finding at a time, draft-first, gold only on Approve; §13 honesty (error≠skip, passes counted vs assessable, operator "Mark resolved"). Migration `20260816170000`: `registry.scope` col (default 'tenant'; core filters `.eq("scope",scope)` so tenant/operator catalogs never mix); `run`/`finding.tenant_id` NULLABLE for operator rows; RLS ADDS a `(tenant_id IS NULL AND is_platform_operator())` branch (§53, does not widen frozen `is_platform_owner()`); 10 Wave-S3 operator checks (8 edge-drivable + 2 honestly DEFERRED git-tag drift — an edge fn can't read git); 2 operator SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`operator_db_health_snapshot`, `operator_rls_coverage_audit`, gated `is_platform_operator() OR service_role`, RAISE 42501). Operator flavor edge fn + hourly cron (`20260816180000`). **§32.a GREEN on prod** (both migrations, scope col, 10 operator rows, 2 RPCs persisted); **§32.b GREEN** (BEGIN..ROLLBACK — tenant sub-account sees 0 operator findings, denied null-tenant write, denied operator RPC). Tenant path byte-identical (§37). **§32.c live-drive owed** (owner drives the Command Center tab).
- ✅ **Systems Check tier-availability fix** (task #99, branch `claude/systems-check-tier-availability`, 2026-08-10). Owner reported the tenant Systems Check missing on fresh sub-accounts. Root cause (§30): the `SystemsCheckTile scope='tenant'` was gated inside the non-empty branch of `PracticeOverview.tsx`'s `{emptyBook ? … : …}`, so any 0-client tenant (solo OR sub-account) saw only the "blank canvas" and never the check. Fix hoists the tile ABOVE the empty/non-empty split (solo + all sub-accounts) AND adds it to `AgencyBoard` (`/agency`, agency's own-business check). Now uniform across **God (`OperatorCommandCenter`) · Agency (`AgencyBoard`) · Standalone/solo + Sub-account (`PracticeOverview`)** — the owner's "repeatable throughout the entire process." Crew: engineer + §39 adversarial (SHIP) + §5 compliance (ITERATE→AgencyBoard gap closed). ESLint 0 / tsc 18-18. Spun off new doctrine **§56** (pre-build tier-matrix gate). **§32.c live-drive owed** (owner confirms the tile on a fresh sub-account + `/agency`).
- 🟡 **Fleet Comms — shared shell + phone-in-thread WIRING shipped; parity NOT yet complete (real data population = Slice 4, task #97/#15)** (PRs #419 Slice 1 atoms · #428 Slice 2 tenant convergence · #431 Slice 3 operator shell + phone bundle, all merged 2026-08-10). SHIPPED: the tenant Client Hub inbox and the operator Fleet Communications inbox render through ONE shared three-column shell (`src/pages/admin/conversations/shell/*`) via a scope-adapter (§18) — the operator surface UI is no longer a bare 2-column surface; phone-in-thread (task #84) human-answered click-to-call + inbound routing + inline `CallBubble` on BOTH scopes (§49, ConvAI AI-answered deferred). **§32.a/b GREEN** (comms-parity + call-schema migrations `20260816190000`/`191000` persisted). **NOT DONE (§13, owner live-drove Super Admin 2026-08-10 → confirmed EMPTY):** the actual product capability — Super Admin auto-populated with REAL contacts + conversations synced from completed tenant onboardings, inline call records, immediate operator-side email/SMS against real data — is GAPPED. That is **Fleet Comms Slice 4 (task #97 / doc #15)**, sequenced BEHIND #9 (People/Pipeline foundation). **Do NOT re-mark "parity complete" here until Slice 4 ships.** §32.c live-drive still owed.
- ✅ **#10 Slice A — Paige chat document types (offer letter + sales offer)** (PR #435, merged 2026-08-10). Extends the existing `document_generate` chat tool (`paige-ai-chat`) — NO new Documents tab/surface (§18/§21): adds `offer_letter` + `sales_offer` to the `doc_type` enum + executor coercion + `StudioDocType` union, and widens `PLACEHOLDER_RE` (ROLE|SALARY|CANDIDATE|COMPENSATION|EQUITY|BENEFITS|POSITION|MANAGER|PROSPECT|EXPIR) so §15 placeholder-guard catches the new kinds. §2-clean (no finance defaults). **Edge deploy GREEN** (`deploy-edge-functions` success on the merge commit). **§32.c owed:** owner asks Paige in chat to draft an offer letter → confirms a real doc lands (no `[PLACEHOLDER]`). D3–D6 (presentations, agreement-edit, §38-gated payment links, preview card) remain sliced follow-ups.
- ✅ **HOTFIX A — callModel open-tier Claude rescue (§34 no-single-provider)** (PR #436, merged 2026-08-10). `_shared/model-router.ts`: the `callModel` route-table `open-flexible`/`open-fast` cells now DEGRADE to the Claude frontier cell on a genuine provider error (assign-not-throw, so the rescue still flows through the §3 voice + §2 finance gates), trace the original featherless error + `fallback_from`, and rethrow the ORIGINAL error only if the rescue itself fails. Closes the "88% open-tier error" P0 (open-flexible had NO fallback and threw). **Edge deploy GREEN** on the merge commit. Complementary to #438 (config side).
- ✅ **HOTFIX B — explicit service-role-only RLS for 2 no-policy tables** (PR #437, merged 2026-08-10, task #102). Migration `20260817000000`: RESTRICTIVE deny-all `service_role_only_deny_jwt` on `booking_notifications_sent` (send-dedup ledger) + `user_presence` (presence telemetry) — both already service-role-only (RLS-on + no-policy already denied JWT); the explicit RESTRICTIVE deny makes it auditable for the operator RLS-coverage check and can NEVER open access (§9/§51-safe; service_role + SECURITY DEFINER RPCs bypass, so edge fns/presence RPCs byte-unaffected, §37). **§32.a PERSISTED-APPLY PROVEN on prod** — `schema_migrations` advanced to `20260817000000` AND both policies confirmed live (`RESTRICTIVE`, roles `{anon,authenticated}`, `USING false`/`WITH CHECK false`).
- ✅ **#19/#103 — Featherless §34 cheap-tier economics restored (config close-loop)** (PR #438, merged 2026-08-10). Owner-side: Antonio subscribed Featherless **"Feather Per-Request" DEVELOPER** ($50/mo credit, per-request billing, NO model-size cap). Code: `_shared/model-router.ts` open-flexible default **8B → `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`** (owner's ranked #1; already allow-listed + already used for `internal_first_draft`; the plan lifts the prior 15B cap; stronger JSON/instruction-following lowers the malformed-output rate that triggers the pricier Claude rescue) + primary env override `FEATHERLESS_DEFAULT_MODEL` (§10 config-as-data; back-compat alias `FEATHERLESS_CHEAP_MODEL`) + stale plan-gate comment corrected. **§30 diagnosis (§13):** the 50 failing `text:open-flexible` traces showed `model=null` — a **trace fidelity artifact** of `emit(...,null,"error")`, NOT a null-slug bug; root cause was pre-plan reachability. §1/§34 crew SHIP no-blockers; §32.b env-precedence resolver + regression-lint GREEN; **edge deploy GREEN** on the merge commit. **§32.c owed:** owner drives a fresh operator Systems Check scan → `operator_llm_failover` returns to `pass` (closes both #438 and HOTFIX A/#436).
- ✅ **Twilio operator comms LIVE (2026-08-10, owner + Cowork live-drive).** Voice both directions live via TwiML App "Paige Operator Voice" (SID `AP54b3f1710789063da21e6454d803f45b`) → `voice-twiml` edge fn; `+14702003444` voice config repointed off the Twilio demo greeting. Two operator secrets set in Supabase Edge Function Secrets: `TWILIO_OPERATOR_TWIML_APP_SID` + `TWILIO_OPERATOR_CALLER_ID` (= `+14702003444`). SMS: Messaging Service "Low Volume Mixed A2P Messaging Service" (SID `MG3852795c9666bd857449d4bbb838e3c2` = `TWILIO_OPERATOR_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID`) inbound wired to `paige-operator-sms-inbound` (`verify_jwt=false`, confirmed ACTIVE); the dead number-level webhook config was blanked; SMS goes live the moment A2P registration approves (~2 days, pending). (§34: recorded here are secret NAMES + the public phone/SID identifiers the owner published in this handoff — no auth tokens or API secrets.)
- ✅ **Fast-follows landed 2026-08-10** (post-Pillar-1): **#95** — Systems Check L2 runner phantom-column fixes (`comms_configured`/`company_info_populated`/`website_connected` now read `tenant_email_identities.tenant_id` + `brand.website`/`brand.business_phone`, §32.b-proven); **#89** — `/admin/team` operator-roster leak closed (`useTeamRoster` scopes an operator-unscoped admin-list-users response down to the active tenant's members).

### Merged 2026-08-11 (this batch) — §9 anon/cross-tenant-reach class closed at BOTH Postgres object types

- ✅ **#55 — Command Center cross-tenant approvals leak** (PR #446, merged 2026-08-11). The first case of the class: `paige_approval_queue_v` had drifted to `security_invoker=off`, so a tenant's Command Center approvals view bypassed RLS and could surface another tenant's rows. Fixed the view; §10 correction #1 reverses Cowork's original "permissive-OR bypass" root-cause naming — the real cause was the `security_invoker=off` VIEW drift.
- ✅ **#116 — 11-view platform-wide `security_invoker` cross-tenant leak + CI drift guard** (PR #447, merged 2026-08-11). Generalized #55: audited every VIEW and closed 11 platform-wide `security_invoker=off` cross-tenant leaks (anon/cross-tenant reachable — the higher-blast-radius class, PII/FICO-reachable). Added the `lint:views` CI drift guard so a view can never silently re-drift off `security_invoker`. Companion to #117 (below) — same underlying mechanism, VIEW object type.
- ✅ **#117 (PR #448) — SECURITY DEFINER function §9 audit** (merged 2026-08-11). Closed **20 confirmed cross-tenant leaks** across authenticated `SECURITY DEFINER` functions — the global-role-bypass + param-IDOR reader patterns, plus **1 HIGH auth bypass** in `delete_credit_report_upload` (it role-checked a caller-SUPPLIED `_calling_user_id` param instead of `auth.uid()`). 2 migrations (`20260821000000` read-hardening, `20260821010000` writer-hardening) + `scripts/ci/definer-fn-lint.mjs` (`lint:definer-fns`) anti-recurrence guard, sibling of `lint:views`. **§32.a/b + §37 producer inventory + §39 peer-gate SHIP.** Companion to #116 (the VIEW class) — same owner-scoped-execution-bypasses-RLS mechanism, different object type. **Honest severity (§13):** #117's 20 leaks are authenticated-only (lower blast radius than #116's anon-reachable PII/FICO), 1 HIGH. **§32.c owed to owner.** New doctrine section drafted (SECURITY DEFINER functions enforce caller scope in-body — PROPOSED in `CLAUDE.md`, companion to #116's view rule). Full anon/cross-tenant-reach class now closed at BOTH object types AND the CI-guard layer (`lint:views` + `lint:definer-fns`).
- ✅ **Doctrine ratification (PR #450, merged 2026-08-11)** — §57 (Super Admin = source of truth) · §58 (Anti-regression) · §59 (SECURITY DEFINER caller-scope-in-body) flipped PROPOSED → **OWNER-LOCKED 2026-08-11**. §58's §39-verifier checklist item ("did this PR silently remove a shipped capability?") is now binding on every PR.
- ✅ **D10 — tier-taxonomy audit + "Portfolio" removal** (PR #451, merged 2026-08-11). Owner live-drive found the Agency `/agency` dashboard rendering a "Portfolio · Your book ranked by traction" section — "Portfolio" is reserved for **Enterprise** tier only (§57) and duplicated "Your sub-accounts" on the same page (§18). Fix: deleted the standalone Portfolio `SectionCard` and **folded all 7 of its capabilities** (health filter chips, health meter, ranking, MRR/Health/Clients columns, Open action) **into the "Your sub-accounts" roster** — §58 nothing lost; metrics overlay the roster by `tenant_id`, absent → "—" not 0 (§13). New shared **`src/lib/agency/tierLabels.ts` `getTierBookNoun()`** helper enforces §57 top-down (Solo/sub_account→"People", agency→"Sub-accounts", enterprise→"Portfolio" RESERVED, operator→"Fleet"); the merged heading + revenue tile derive from it. Codex review caught 2 real correctness fixes (book-noun from agency context when scoped into a child; `portfolioLoading` in the table loading state) — both applied pre-merge. Locked tier taxonomy: **People / Sub-accounts / Portfolio / Fleet.** §30 scout + §39/§5 SHIP + §25 design critic SHIP. **§32.c live-drive owed to owner.** Fast-follows (task #119): uncapped metric overlay for >20-child agencies (`agency_portfolio_metrics` caps at 20 — pre-existing), and `getTierBookNoun` adoption on the aligned Fleet/People sites.
- ✅ **#121 — same-tier feature parity: §16 department block** (PR #453, merged 2026-08-11). Owner live-drive: MMA renders the §16 "What your Paige team is doing" 10-department block on Command Center; sibling PME sub-accounts do not. **§30 audit DISPROVED the stale-classification hypothesis (§13/§30):** the block is NOT gated by tenant_id/`account_type`/`features`/historical tier — all four PME tenants are confirmed `sub_account`. The real discriminator is `emptyBook` (book data-state): the block was nested *inside* the non-empty branch of `PracticeOverview.tsx`'s empty-state conditional, so MMA (2 clients) rendered it while 0-client siblings got the blank-canvas EmptyState. Same class as task #99 (Systems Check tile). **Fix:** hoisted `PaigeDepartmentStatus` *above* the `emptyBook` split (mirroring `SystemsCheckTile`) → renders on every same-tier tenant regardless of book state. The platform-wide sweep found **ZERO** other feature-gate leaks; Marketplace/playbook/`finance_in_scope` are legitimate per-tenant opt-in (§2), not leaks. §32.c live-drive owed. (Owner then ruled the `getTierFeatureSet()` structural-enforcement helper MANDATORY — its own PR; see §10 #7.)
- ✅ **#122 — Systems Check load perf** (PR #454, merged 2026-08-11). §30: NOT a DB problem (slowest query 0.24ms, tables fully indexed) — latency was 2-3 serialized PostgREST round-trips per tile mount re-paid on every navigation (`staleTime:0`). Fix: new **`systems_check_snapshot(p_scope)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC** (migration `20260822000000`) collapses the round-trips into one; §59-clean (tenant from `current_user_tenant_id()` in-body, operator gated on `is_platform_operator()`, invalid scope raises, authenticated-only); `useSystemsCheck.ts` calls it + adds `staleTime:60_000`. NO index changes, NO check-run semantics change. §32.a parse-proof + §32.b row-match (MMA 10=10, no fan-out) + §39 peer-gate SHIP. §32.c live-drive owed.
- ✅ **Skills Wave S1 FOUNDATION** (PR #466, merged 2026-08-11) — the provable slices of S1, split from the deferred interpreter per CC's §5 call. **S1a schema:** `ALTER paige_skills` ADD `methodology_anchor` (GOAT anchor, §35), `tier_availability` jsonb (§61 default doc), `scoping` text CHECK('platform','tenant'), `autonomy_lane` text CHECK('auto','confirm','off') — the switch(slug) runner does NOT read these yet, so §58 byte-identical is protected by construction. 4 shipped skills backfilled (anchor per skill, scoping=platform, autonomy_lane per risk: read_only→auto, draft/send→confirm; tier_availability=§61 default). §32.a rollback-proven (cols=4·anchors=4·scoping=4·lane_auto=2·lane_confirm=2·tier_resell=4); §32.a persisted-apply via deploy-migrations. **Fork-1 finding (§10):** `autonomy_lane` is NOT a shared pg enum — it's duplicated text+CHECK on the action-bus spine; S1a copies the pattern (no type to reuse). **§60/§61 self-use Feature:** added `skills` to tierFeatures.ts SOLO/SUB/GOD sets (enterprise via Solo-union), NOT agency — the §61 self-use gate; agency's "resell" is a Marketplace concept, not a Set bit (Fork-3 ruling). Test locks the cell (19/19). **S1c docs:** `docs/doctrine/skills-vocabulary.md` (the 4 "skill" concepts: paige_skills recipe / marketplace add-on / paige_subagents specialist / methodology anchor) + inline disambiguation comments at skill-runner/skill-forge/subagent-forge/marketplace-skills.ts + brain README line. **DEFERRED to a fresh session (turnkey plan in `scratchpad/skills-wave-s1-substrate.md` + task #126):** S1b steps-interpreter (owner ruled FULL interpreter — the highest-§58-risk slice, needs a live-function byte-identical proof, held per §5 rather than rushed at a saturated session-end) + S1d format-picker. Ordering ruling owed at next S1 open: interpreter-first (owner-owed §32.c proof) vs Paige self-verify browser-agent first (automates the proof).
- ✅ **Skills Wave S1b INTERPRETER + S1d format-picker** (PR #467, 2026-08-11) — **INFRASTRUCTURE for the S2 GOAT professional-skills content wave, NOT "the intelligence" itself** (owner clarification, §10 2026-08-11): the interpreter is the plumbing that lets N professional skills scale WITHOUT N bespoke handlers; the intelligence comes from the S2 GOAT-anchored content seed that follows. `paige_skills` recipes now RUN generically, not just the 4 bespoke slugs. **`_shared/skill-interpreter-core.ts`** (pure, vitest-tested — 21 tests) + **`_shared/skill-interpreter.ts`** (Deno orchestrator) wired into `skill-runner`'s dispatch as an ADDITIVE default-case path. Reads the skill ROW → forges the generative core through the EXISTING `forge()` seam (§26 — methodology_anchor leads, cheesy-tells/brand bind, `is_platform_default` from `scoping`), applies the §16 autonomy clamp (`auto`→execute / `confirm`→files a `paige_pending_approvals` draft / `off`→brief) **with a structural RISK FLOOR** (external_send/mutating can NEVER auto-execute), the §60/§61 tier belt (`tier_availability`; `resell`=marketplace-only, denied self-run), and §9/§59 server-resolved tenant (contact wins, mismatch rejected as IDOR). **§16 GUARANTEE:** the interpreter has NO external-send call site — a send only ever happens later from the approved-send seam. **§58 by construction:** the 4 shipped slugs stay byte-identical on their bespoke handlers (interpreter only runs non-bespoke slugs; `force_interpreter` is diff-tooling only, NOT in the `paige-mcp` schema). **S1d format-picker:** a document skill asks Word/Google Doc/PDF/Markdown before generating (`needs_input`). **§58 automation:** `scripts/skills-s58-harness.mjs` + `tests/fixtures/skills-s58-baseline/` capture baselines (`--capture`) + prove bespoke-vs-interpreter parity (`--diff`). Verified headless (CC lacks the paige-mcp connection): tsc 0 · vitest 241/241 · lint:tier-features clean · §16 no-send + §9 tenant-scope structurally confirmed. **§32.c live-drive (fire a forged skill via `run_skill`) + Slice 1/3 MCP baseline+diff = owed to Cowork** (the capable MCP session). **Design-review crew (§1) caught 5 MUST-FIX pre-merge** (see §10). **Follow-up:** approve→execute consumer (an approved skill_draft has no wired executor yet — the draft IS the deliverable for MVP); regenerate `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` (stale, missing S1a cols — non-blocking, Deno/any runner).
- ✅ **Gap 3 (Tashia live-drive) — approval-Send "no email on file" + headless-approval guard** (PR #464 frontend + PR #465 backend, merged 2026-08-11). Owner live-drive: Send on a queued approval linked to a contact WITH a valid email rendered "Contact has no email on file". §30: `ApprovalDetail.sendDraft` read ONLY `contact?.email`, populated only when `approval.contact_id` is non-null — an approval filed UNLINKED (contact_id NULL, the downstream effect of the #462 contact-search false-miss) always tripped the guard. **#464:** `sendDraft` now mirrors the backend `execute-approval` resolution (snapshot `draft_content.to` → live contact → re-resolve `clients.email` by id), passes `contact_id ?? null` (send-message pins a null-contact send to the caller's tenant, §9). **#465 fast-follow (owner "make sure it never happens again"):** live-prod audit found 4 approvals, 2 orphans, BOTH with no `contact_id` AND no `draft_content.to` AND no recoverable recipient signal → **0 backfillable** (§13, no guessing); the deliverable is the guard — migration `20260825000000` adds a `NOT VALID` CHECK (`category NOT IN ('email','sms') OR contact_id IS NOT NULL OR draft_content->>'to' IS NOT NULL`) grandfathering the 2 legacy rows + enforcing on all new send approvals, plus an app-level clean-error guard in `paige-ai-chat` (no raw constraint error). §32.a rollback-proven (headless blocked · recipient'd allowed · workflow untouched · legacy grandfathered); §37: paige-ai-chat email/sms sends guarded, paige-mcp workflow_run approvals unaffected (category NULL). §32.a persisted-apply via deploy-migrations. §32.c live-drive owed.
- ✅ **#127 — Paige contact-lookup false-negative + lookup-honesty** (PR #462, merged 2026-08-11). Owner live-drive: Paige told the operator "no contact named Tashia Anderson on file" when the contact existed. **§30 diagnosis found TWO independent defects wearing one face (§13):** (1) the CRM search matched the WHOLE query phrase against EACH single column (`or(first_name.ilike.%Tashia Anderson%, …)`), so a real row with `first_name="Tashia"` + `last_name="Anderson"` (SEPARATE columns) matched 0 rows — every multi-word/full-name lookup false-missed; (2) an UNRELATED nested tool (content-draft/generate-image) 500'd and its error was narrated as if the *lookup* failed — the owner conflated the two symptoms. **Fix (§18 one home):** new `supabase/functions/_shared/contact-search.ts` tokenizes the query — each token ORs across `[first_name,last_name,email,entity_name,phone]`, tokens AND-combine via chained PostgREST `.or()` (`and(or(tok0…),or(tok1…))`); single-token queries are byte-identical to the old one-group behavior (no regression). Wired into all 3 lookup tools: `paige-ai-chat crm_search_contacts` (all-mode), `paige-mcp search_contacts` (all-mode), `paige-mcp search_clients_fuzzy` (any-mode + `city`, preserves the isGod §9 scope branch). Plus a **LOOKUP HONESTY** prompt block: found / found-nothing / could-not-check are three distinct outcomes, NEVER collapsed into "no record." CI regression guard `src/__tests__/contact-search.test.ts` (11 tests, imports the pure helper). **§32.b PROVEN on prod** (old filter 0 hits, new all-mode 1 hit, any-mode 1 hit, single-token 1 hit for the real Tashia Anderson row). tsc 0 · vitest green. §32.c owner live-drive owed (Tashia resolves on MMA + other sub-accounts).

- ✅ **Solo Business Game Plan — the new DEFAULT Command Center landing** (branch `claude/business-game-plan-ui-rxuju3`, owner-approved visual direction 2026-09-05). The Solo Command Center gains a first sub-tab, **Business Game Plan** (`src/solo/SoloGamePlanWorkspace.tsx`), and it becomes the default landing: bare `/command-center` and legacy `/command-center/overview` redirect (`replace`) to `/command-center/business-game-plan` (the `business-game-plan` slug carries `overview` as a `SOLO_BRANCHES` alias). Sub-tab order is now **Business Game Plan → Systems Check → Trust Compass → Mind** — four REAL tabs (Trust Compass shipped its real governed sub-tab in PR #975, **SOLO ONLY** — sub-account DEFERRED per the owner ruling 2026-09-06 "no subaccount delivery without explicit release", gated via the `trust_compass` §60 Feature; see the tier-matrix Trust Compass ledger). No dead/placeholder tab (§58). **No new table/RPC/edge/migration/tier-flag** — a §18 composition hook (`src/solo/data/useSoloGamePlan.ts`) over already-released tenant-safe reads (`useCommandCenter`, `useSoloSetupBrief`, `useCatalogOffers`, `useSoloKnowledge`, `useSoloPendingActions`, `useSystemsCheck("tenant")`, `useSoloActivityFeed`), passing **no** client-supplied `tenant_id` (§9). Every visible figure is a real numerator/denominator over five grounding foundations or says "incomplete"/"couldn't load"; an empty recorded feed reads "No recorded work yet" (§13); every primary action routes to a real, authorized surface or opens the one PAIGE conversation (§corr #4); no route string/provider name/internal id reaches visible copy (§corr #3). **§70 fix caught in build:** the kicker read `accountContext?.name` when the resolved prop is `{accountName, accountType, accountTypeLabel}`, so the owner's account name never rendered — now resolves via `resolveTenantAccountContext` and emits the canonical `data-tenant-account-name`/`-tier` shell markers (§65). Tiers: Standalone Solo ✓ (default landing) · Sub-account — (sequenced: sub-accounts render via `AgencyApp` at `/business` today, so they still land on the Agency Core; the §60 parity gap closes when `/business` mounts `SoloApp` — a separate §65 slice) · Agency/God — separate shells (—) · Client/Anonymous 403. **Verified:** full vitest suite green (3416), build green, typecheck-clean typed files, 64/64 headless render drive (all states × light/dark × 4 Solo viewports). **§32.c authenticated owner live-drive OWED** (headless CI sandbox has no browser/auth tool). Tier-matrix Surface ledger updated same-PR (§66). **▸ SLICE A reshape — SHIPPED 2026-09-06 (owner-approved reimagination, PR #988):** the surface is REPLACED IN PLACE into the owner's **strategy desk** — the spine is now the owner's approved strategy (an **editable Plan Brief** that persists via the existing `useSoloSetupBrief.save` → `save_solo_setup_context` seam, §70/§18 — no new write path; a horizon navigator; Strategic plays from real `campaign_briefs` via an added `useSoloCampaignBriefs` read; a Decision & Opportunity swipe deck; a Paige operating-contribution card), and **Systems Check is DEMOTED to a collapsible "Plan dependencies"** — never the spine (a Systems Check read outage shows an honest "Couldn't check", never a false "All clear"). Every value carries a source class derived from real provenance; still §9-clean (no client `tenant_id`); a plain Plan-Brief edit passes `proposalId=null` so it never consumes a pending Paige proposal. Peer-gate (§39) + compliance (§5) caught 3 defects pre-ship (edit-drawer focus-steal that made 6/7 fields uneditable; a false-all-clear on a Systems Check outage; two `res.error` tsc-narrowing errors) — all fixed with regression tests. **Verified:** full vitest green (3547+), tsc ratchet green (baseline 13, no new errors), regression-lint green, render drive 128/128, scroll drive 6/6. **STILL DEFERRED (§13):** a first-class strategic-plan store, structured pillars, and the Mission System (`campaign_briefs.mission_id` reserved/unwritten) — plays come from existing campaign briefs. **§32.c owner live-drive still OWED.**

  Setup uses, so one record with two editors, never two records (§57). Owner-only; the canonical
  adapter mounts only when the editor is opened, so the ordinary Registration view is unchanged.
  Reachable by top-level standalone Solo tenants only, which is exactly the set
  `solo_setup_assert_canonical_tenant()` admits — pinned by a contract test so the two gates
  cannot silently drift apart (§51/§56).
- ✅ **`20261201000700` — the representative identity nobody was writing.** §32.a CONFIRMED on prod
  (ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`): `schema_migrations` advanced **958 → 959**, `max(version)` =
  `20261201000700`, all **three** triggers present. Before it, NO function in the product wrote
  `authorized_representative_first_name` / `_last_name` / `_email` / `_business_title` —
  `20261046000000` replaced `save_solo_setup_identity` with an upsert omitting all four — so
  `missingProfile()` could never empty and **brand filing was structurally impossible for every
  Solo workspace**. Now derived at the table from the named active Team member, with sibling
  triggers on `tenant_members` and `profiles` so a departure or a later name change re-derives.
  **Backfill measured on prod: 1 workspace named a representative and 1 was blocked; after the
  apply, 0 blocked.** Honest limit recorded in the migration header: a change to
  `auth.users.email` re-derives nothing (that table is the auth service's), so the address can be
  stale until the next membership change, profile edit or Setup save.
- ✅ **A grant-boundary regression caught before it shipped (§39).** The peer-gate found a browser
  `select()` for the three provider SIDs `20261201000600` deliberately excludes from the
  `authenticated` grant — it would have made Registration `unreadable` for every workspace while
  every test stayed green. Lockedness now comes from `comms-a2p-register`'s server-computed
  `has_brand`/`has_campaign`/`has_messaging_service`. Recorded in `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md`.
- 🟡 **OWED — §32.c authenticated live-drive.** Frontend is live (Vercel production `READY` on
  `a8862ee`) and the schema is persisted, but NO ONE has driven the deployed surface. A green
  pipeline proves the code runs; it does not prove an owner can finish the registration.
- ❌ **NOT built — a governed PAIGE seam for these fields.** `business_context.readiness` exposes
  status + provenance for four fields and never a raw value; nothing lets Paige write any of them.
  A write tool needs the one-approval-gate contract, an action-risk classification and Rail events.

### Solo Settings → Connections Add channel (PR #967, LIVE 2026-09-05)

- ✅ **The generic Available catalogue is now the business-channel control desk.** `connections/available`
  is visibly **Add channel**, grouped by Email and inbox, Phone and messaging, and Calendar and
  booking. It shows only source-backed operating channels, withholds its one best-next recommendation
  while required reads are unresolved or unavailable, and routes setup to Communications,
  Registration, Health, or Calendars. External apps, automations, APIs, social/data systems, and
  specialist tools have one explicit Integrations handoff; Integrations itself was not redesigned.
- ✅ **Operating-state truth is tenant-safe and fail-closed.** Prior-workspace identity/readiness values
  are synchronously masked. A sender counts only when its canonical identity is active or its Google
  sending account is proven connected; a phone counts only when the canonical readiness record proves
  `can_send_sms`. Pending, configured-unverified, degraded, registration-required, resolving,
  failed-read, and unavailable remain distinct. The Add-channel surface performs no provider mutation.
- ✅ **Exact release proof.** Owner approved exact source head `a1b317d8`; PR #967 squash-merged as
  `bc89d79c`, whose tree equals the approved head tree (`bd2cf4b4`). Vercel production deployment
  `dpl_8n1eP8n1Qyik2XVXZCeDLSKKTer1` is `READY` for `bc89d79c`; `paigeagent.ai`,
  `app.paigeagent.ai`, and the three Vercel aliases point to it. The public Connections route returned
  HTTP 200, its live Solo bundle contained the five release fingerprints, and the one-hour Vercel
  runtime-error scan was clean.
- 🟡 **OWED — authenticated owner live-drive.** Local proof is 188 focused tests plus 170 real-shell
  checks across all four Solo viewports, both themes, two synthetic tenant contexts, PAIGE open/closed,
  keyboard/focus, reflow, and reduced motion. No signed-in production owner session or real provider
  account was exercised, so authenticated tenant/provider behavior remains **UNVERIFIED**.

## 5. Current focus + known gaps

### Paige modality neutrality — OWNER-LOCKED platform rule (2026-09-06; acceptance contract, not a capability claim)

Text chat, Live Conversation, future phone/SIP, Secure Browser interactions, contextual handoffs,
and platform cards are interfaces to the **one tenant-aware Paige workspace** and **one PAIGE
Spine**. Every request follows one path: receive text/voice/UI intent → server-resolve actor, tenant,
workspace, page/object context, and role → use the shared Spine registry and existing authority
decision → call the canonical governed tool/RPC only when available and authorized → verify the
canonical persisted outcome → create the detailed action receipt and matching Rail evidence →
present the truthful result through the active modality → allow only approved, source-backed,
owner-confirmed material to become Brain/Mind/Memory eligible. Raw chat text, raw voice audio, and
raw transcripts are never automatic durable facts.

Spoken answers may select ordinary conversational options where policy permits. Money movement,
authority change, external-impact work, and every other consequential action retain the existing
standing-authority/confirmation policy, readback, receipt, and Rail requirements; a casual spoken
"yes" never substitutes for approval proof. Workspace switch, end, denial, retry, revoke, and
expiry clear or fail closed exactly as chat does. A modality never creates a second brain, direct
mutation path, duplicate authority system, ungoverned memory store, or evidence-state upgrade. Do
not claim voice parity with a capability that is `UNAVAILABLE`, `PARTIAL`, `UNVERIFIED`, or `PROOF
OWED`. Canonical contract and future-surface acceptance checklist:
`docs/doctrine/paige-modality-neutrality.md`; Second Brain checklist:
`docs/brain/paige-brain-wiring-standard.md` §3.

- **Business Vault binary inspection remains UNAVAILABLE:** activate only after an owner-approved OCR/DLP provider and service-owned worker prove PDF/image OCR, secret and financial-sensitive detection, timeouts, encrypted/malformed handling, exact-byte promotion, cleanup compensation, and authenticated storage behavior. Provider-neutral quarantine schema is present; service-role promotion is deliberately revoked. Client publishing, provider ingestion, legal interpretation, automated execution, and broad document-to-memory promotion remain later phases. Active collision handoff: #724 is adjacent; #917 overlaps the narrow Settings/header/config seam and must preserve both Integrations/Vault `openPaige`, Vault layout/header treatment, current Connections copy, `solo-contact-import`, and all three Vault JWT blocks.
### Connections after Add channel — remaining real-provider and runtime proof gaps (2026-09-05)

Inbound mailbox reading and non-SMS business messaging remain **UNAVAILABLE** because no supported
read/permission contract is proven. Calendar and booking state remains owned and verified inside
Calendars rather than duplicated in Add channel. Provider OAuth completion, real-account
permissions, production tenant truth, and authenticated workspace switching remain **UNVERIFIED**
until the post-deploy owner drive. Integrations retains external apps, automations, APIs, social
tools, data systems, and specialist tools; this release does not redesign that page.

### The Paige Capability System — OWNER-LOCKED full-range MVP direction (2026-09-05; a DECISION + matrix, NOT live capability claims)

Owner-locked: **PAIGE is the tenant's governed operating environment; chat is the front door to a FULL
range of real capabilities** — do NOT narrow to chat-only / read-only / recommendation-only. This is ONE
**Paige Capability System** (governed capability contracts), not unrelated chat widgets. Full plan +
capability contracts + the 7-slice sequencing: `outputs/paige-at-cowork/09-paige-capability-system.md`.
Every consequential capability is tenant-isolated, authorization-gated, records a Rail outcome, and
preserves source/provenance; connected workers (n8n/Zapier/MCP/provider APIs/browser) are execution
workers UNDER Paige's authority, never a bypass; one approval path for send/publish/spend (no chat
shortcut); no capability called live on a static UI/prototype/helper (§13/§32/§70). Grounded by six
read-only scouts (file:line-citable).

**Dependency-ordered capability matrix — honest state (2026-09-05):**
- **Read & understand** — LIVE/PARTIAL (RLS + `current_user_tenant_id()`; Spine `evidence` provenance).
- **Create artifacts in chat (image·document·copy·page·funnel·form)** — **LIVE core** (`generate_image`
  4-provider, `document_generate` 8-type, copy, growth studio; durable home `marketing_content`
  `status='draft'`; `save_marketing_content`; `chatArtifacts`→`PaigeArtifactCard`; `studio_artifact_versions`).
  **DOCUMENT EXPORT — SHIPPED (Task #21, 2026-09-06):** a document created with `document_generate` can now
  be turned into a REAL downloadable file — the new `export-document` edge function (the §10 callable seam)
  renders it via the existing in-band `doc-render` lane → private `studio-deliverables` bucket → 30-day
  signed `download_url` + `document_export` Rail outcome; `document_generate` gained an optional
  `export_format` (pdf/docx/pptx/md) that returns the link inline. **AUTHORIZATION (§9/§59):** the source
  row is read with the SERVICE-ROLE client (a privileged, RLS-bypassing read — `marketing_content` RLS
  refuses a fresh Solo owner AND a platform_admin), then authorized IN-BODY *before* any kind/tenant-shape
  response: a MANAGE role in the ROW'S tenant (owner/admin via `is_tenant_admin`, coach via `has_tenant_role`)
  OR a platform operator; a non-authorized caller fails CLOSED as a 404. NOT a coarse admin/coach global gate,
  NOT RLS-trusting. Honest state (AGENTS.md vocab): **md — PARTIAL** (serializer proven headlessly; the
  authenticated end-to-end download drive is §32.c owed), **pdf/docx/pptx — UNVERIFIED** (renderers
  source-checked, each fail-closed to needs_config, not runtime-driven on Deno here), **§32.c owner drive
  OWED**. GAPS: **xlsx = UNAVAILABLE** (tabular, needs a new lib — named follow-up); an export-ONLY path for
  an existing doc (today `export_format` regenerates + version-stacks — L3 follow-up `task_6d770114`); a
  re-download control on the artifact card
  (Claude Design's, §00); **native Google Docs/Sheets/Slides = UNAVAILABLE** (provider-gated: no Docs/Sheets/
  Slides API client and no tenant Drive OAuth scope — tenant Google carries only gmail.send + calendar.events;
  a platform-ops-only Lovable-gateway Drive path exists in `ship-26-legacy-cleanup` but is not a tenant
  authoring seam; an Integration Capability Registry ENTRY + a Google provider contract are prerequisites);
  multi-surface card render,
  image→campaign routing, other missing types (HTML email_template · video · social-schedule).
- **Upload/download & inspect files** — **LIVE** (upload+inspect: `useChatDocumentUpload` 10MB pdf/img/docx,
  read-check + approve-to-apply extraction, `kb-ingest-file`; folder-scoped storage RLS + server-side scope
  refusal). PARTIAL: no generic chat→file download. **INJECTION FENCE — SHIPPED (Slice 2, Task #18,
  2026-09-06):** uploaded file content is now fenced as untrusted DATA, not instructions —
  `_shared/untrusted-fence.ts` (`fenceUploadedFileText` + `UPLOADED_FILE_UNTRUSTED_NOTICE`, the §18 one home
  mirroring the team-context text fence) wraps the extracted DOCX text and leads both `baseInstruction`
  branches (covering the PDF/image vision surface). Behavior-preserving (§37); `src/solo/untrusted-fence.test.ts`
  + source-contract guard. **Accurate threat (Codex P1, verified):** an attachment request takes the
  direct-stream branch; the tool-executing agentic loop is gated to NON-document turns, so malicious file
  content can steer the answer/extraction but cannot directly drive Paige's mutating tools on that turn (the
  fence guards the steer today and is load-bearing once attachments are ever routed into the tool loop).
  **RETRIEVED/FETCHED/REMEMBERED-CONTENT FENCE — SHIPPED (Slice 2 inc 2, Task #20, 2026-09-06):** FIVE
  co-located UNTRUSTED, marker-capable content blocks that reach the SAME tool-executing system prompt are now
  fenced — the retrieved-KB block (`=== TENANT KNOWLEDGE ===`, OCR-fed) + `ragContext` (`match_rag_documents`,
  client-financial-fed) carry `RETRIEVED_KNOWLEDGE_UNTRUSTED_NOTICE` + per-chunk `sanitizeUntrustedText`; the
  operator-authored/approved `knowledge_base` gets marker/control hygiene only (trusted); and — folded after the
  §39 + §5 crews caught the §37 half-fix — the two WORST surfaces `fetchedUrlContent` (arbitrary web content on
  the privileged seat) and `memoryBlock` (durable, cross-principal) now carry the notice + sanitized spans (§18
  reuse of `untrusted-fence.ts`). MORE load-bearing than the attachment fence: these reach tool-executing turns.
  Behavior-preserving (§37, all load-bearing markers preserved); `src/solo/untrusted-fence.test.ts` (27).
  **NAMED next increment:** `sessionDocContext` / `clientContext` / funding `userContext` (lower-severity, same
  class). **STILL OPEN:** a generic chat→file download primitive + content-sniffing beyond the MIME allow-list.
  §32.c authenticated malicious-content drive OWED (headless).
- **Write & operate native records** — LIVE (wired: `deal_move_stage` honest outcome S1/S1.1; the three
  CRM/scheduling write-receipts `crm_log_activity`/`calendar_book_meeting`/`crm_create_task` now file a
  capability-Rail outcome too — Slice 3 increment 1, Task #19, `_shared/crm-capability-outcome.ts`; content/
  document/growth writes) / PARTIAL (~40 remaining consequential actions still write only `paige_audit_log`,
  not the Rail — F05 continuation; `crm_create_contact` needs a per-capability branch for its dedup-clarify).
- **Research (bounded web)** — LIVE/PARTIAL (`deep_research` + `web_search` + `browse_public_url`; gaps per §5
  Sandboxed-Research entry below).
- **External execution / integrations** — PARTIAL (chat path governed; `paige-mcp` tier+scope only, no risk
  gate; sub-agent downstream ungoverned; `decideGovernedExecution` unwired).
- **Communications/publishing/spend** — PARTIAL/approval-gated (comms LIVE; §38 money boundary; one approval
  path exists but not unified across MCP/sub-agent).
- **Sandbox (isolated untrusted/generated-code exec)** — UNAVAILABLE/greenfield (substrate under files/
  research/advanced actions).
- **Evidence (Rail/Spine/Mind)** — Rail **PARTIAL/proof-owed** (`record_capability_run` 6 outcomes, RPC
  deployed + wired via S1/S1.1, but §32.c live-drive OWED — 0 prod rows, end-to-end unproven, Codex P1);
  Mind PARTIAL (`paige_owner_memory` schema LIVE, no tenant writer — F02 handoff dep).

**Seven owner-sequenced slices (LOCKED):** (1) chat artifact creation + tenant-scoped storage incl image gen
[LIVE→harden+reach+fill-types] → (2) safe upload/download + inspection [+the injection fence, net-new] → (3)
governed native writes [F05 continuation] → (4) bounded browser research → (5) governed worker dispatch → (6)
one approval path [unify across all doors] → (7) advanced browser automation/publishing/comms/paid-media/
recurring [PLANNED; §67/§68, §64]. Each capability declares its contract (tenant isolation, authz, audit/
outcome, provenance, safe-failure, durable home). **Same-slice refresh discipline:** each completed slice
updates this matrix with shipped/evidence/proof-owed/next-owner/dep-order (§0/§66/§BRAIN.3).

**Slice 1 progress (2026-09-05):** _increment 1 — truthful artifact-creation receipts_ (PR #972). Five
creation handlers (`generate_image`, `draft_marketing_content`, `content_save`, `document_generate`,
`growth_page_save`) no longer emit a `success:true` receipt on a 200-with-empty-payload (null url / empty
drafts / null saved id); a new pure home `_shared/artifact-receipt.ts` (`artifactProduced` +
`ARTIFACT_ABSENT_ERROR`) degrades an absent artifact to an honest `success:false`, so the model narration,
the status label, and the artifact card all inherit the honest signal (§13/§70). **Proof:** 17 contract
tests + 167 green across the source-asserting suite; §50 clean; transpiles clean. Increment 1.1 (PR #974)
folded two Codex-caught edge-cases (Studio image needs a filed `content_id`; a drafts array of
content-less items isn't usable copy). **Proof owed:** authenticated owner §32.c live-drive (headless).
**Slice 1 — dedicated-chat in-place image refine: BACKEND SHIPPED (2026-09-06, task #15).** Refining an image
Paige just made in the dedicated chat now version-stacks the SAME artifact: a SERVER-OWNED per-(tenant,thread)
anchor on `paige_chat_threads` (never a client/model-supplied id — the model's `target_content_id` is only a
refine-intent echo, re-checked against the server anchor) drives a version-preserving reuse —
`save_marketing_content` snapshots the prior image into `meta.versions[]` before the tenant-scoped overwrite,
so prior images are never silently lost (§18 one-home / §58-safe: no new table, no touch to shipped
`studio_artifact_versions`; §9 unchanged; `meta.versions` is server-owned — un-wipeable/un-forgeable).
Proven 10/10 on real Postgres 16 + 7/7 wiring guard; §39 verifier + §5 compliance folded (FK index, race lock).
**Proof owed (§32.c):** the frontend version-history UI + authenticated end-to-end live-drive (headless).
**Still in slice 1 — re-scoped to the DEDICATED Paige experience (owner decision 2026-09-06):**
download/export action, image→campaign routing, the missing types (campaign_brief · HTML email_template ·
video · social-schedule). **RETIRED:** "render the artifact card on all chat
surfaces" — there is NO floating Paige chat inside the authenticated platform; the dedicated authenticated
Paige chat/workspace is the only tenant-aware experience and already renders the card (see §10 corrections
+ decision-log 2026-09-06; retirement work = task #14). A public-site Product Guide is a separate,
tenant-isolated product, not built here. **Deferred to their slices, named:** the two going-live PUBLISH
receipts (slice 6/7) and Rail wiring of these tools (slice 3 / F05).

**Slice 2 — campaign-brief conversational create/list/revise reach: SHIPPED (2026-09-06, task #16).** Paige can now,
in the dedicated Solo chat, draft / revise / list a workspace's **campaign briefs** — an owner-authored PLANNING
record of a campaign's intent (objective, audience, positioning, intended channels, desired outcome, budget TARGET,
timing). REGISTERED, not hand-wired: new Spine domain `_shared/paige-spine/domains/campaigns.ts` (`campaign.create`/
`.revise`/`.list` + compact `CAMPAIGN_BRIEF_TOOLS`), added to the registry; the Chat handler consumes via
`...CAMPAIGN_BRIEF_TOOLS` + a name-keyed dispatch branch (owner Spine ruling 2026-09-01; `chat-tool-registry`
baseline unchanged at 94). Consumes the EXISTING secure RPCs UNCHANGED — `configure_campaign_brief` +
`get_campaign_briefs` (merged migration `20261225000000`) — via the caller JWT with `_actor_kind:'paige'`, so the
SECURITY DEFINER RPC re-resolves tenant from auth (never the arg, §9/§59) and gates on tenant-admin/owner (§53). No
RPC/table change → no §37 producer break. **AUTHORITY (owner correction 2026-09-06):** create/revise are classified
`ordinary` — the class the runtime clamp leaves eligible for a standing `auto` grant, so a tenant owner/authorized
rep CAN grant Paige autonomous authority to draft/revise briefs within their approved scope; `confirm` is the
ESCALATION lane (platform default, and where the RPC refuses out-of-policy / ambiguous / unavailable-linked-record /
version-conflict). A blanket draft/confirm on every planning write was explicitly rejected. New migration
`20261229000000` adds the two writes to the `list_tool_autonomy` catalogue so the operator can see + set their lane.
**PROVEN:** `scripts/campaign-brief-db-proof.mjs` 12/12 on real Postgres 16 (create/version/tenant-scope, §9
cross-tenant FORBIDDEN 42501 no-leak, §53 non-admin FORBIDDEN, optimistic VERSION_CONFLICT 40001, idempotency
replay-returns-stored + conflict 22023, offer tenant-mismatch 23514, operator bypass); structural guard 14/14; full
vitest 3722/3722; all governance lints + tsc + registry validator green. **HONEST BOUNDARY:** a brief is INTENT —
never proof ads are active, money was spent, content was published, or results occurred; those need their own
connected governed actions and verified outcomes. **Proof owed (§32.c):** authenticated end-to-end Solo-chat
create/revise/list live-drive (headless session cannot render/drive it) — owed to a browser-capable session.

**P1 UI hotfix — dedicated Paige chat scrollbar + real permission chip: SHIPPED (2026-09-06, task #17).** Two fixes
to the dedicated Solo Paige workspace chat (`paige.workspace`). **(1) Horizontal scrollbar fixed at the SOURCE:** the
message bubble (the app-branch flex item every live mount uses) lacked `min-w-0` so it couldn't shrink and pushed the
transcript wide; fixed with `min-w-0` + user-text `whitespace-pre-wrap break-words` + transcript `overflow-x-hidden`
(safe because content now wraps — nothing clipped) + `EntityDiagramCard` **and** wide GFM tables self-scroll in their own `overflow-x-auto` containers for genuinely-wide content (`MarkdownMessage` `table` override).
The transcript stays the one vertical scroll owner; the composer action row is `flex-wrap`. **(2) Real permission
chip** in the composer (`PaigeComposerAutonomyChip`, Solo-only via a new `composerAutonomyControl` prop): reflects the
workspace's REAL effective posture via `useSoloToolGovernance` (the canonical `set_tool_autonomy` seam); "Ask first"
is a real admin-gated persisted brake (bulk `set_tool_autonomy=confirm`); "Act within my policy"/"Custom permissions"
route to the real Trust Compass controls. No global posture seam exists, so the chip never blanket-enables `auto` and
never fakes a write (§13/§18); a pre-existing FAKE static "Ask first" header badge was removed (§13 correction).
Radix DropdownMenu (keyboard/Escape/focus-restore); neutral/violet, gold reserved for Send. **PROVEN:** DOM-contract
overflow guard + chip authority-state tests (pure `deriveChipView` all states + trigger render) + Solo workspace
contract green; ci:tsc/gold-discipline/tier-features/binding-ledger green; full vitest + build green. **KNOWN LIMIT
(§18 follow-up):** a true non-destructive *global* posture-override layer belongs to the pending Trust Compass
reconciliation slice — this hotfix reuses the one per-tool seam, does not fork it. **Proof owed (§32.c):**
rendered-pixel + authenticated-runtime verification (no-scrollbar layout + live chip write/route) at the five
viewports × both themes × PAIGE open/closed — owed to a browser-capable session (headless, no browser). Evidence:
`docs/evidence/ui-delivery/dedicated-paige-chat-scrollbar-and-permission-chip.md`.
**§39/§5 FOLD (pre-merge):** the peer-gate + compliance officer caught (and this PR fixed) a real §13 chip
defect — the standing-grant signal keyed on the domain-`guardrails` aggregate, unreachable because every
domain has a `high`-risk tool capped at `confirm`, so the chip could never leave "Ask first" and would
understate a real `auto` grant; re-keyed to the tool level (`byTool` effective `auto`) with a reachability
test over the real `deriveGovernance`. Also folded: the wide-GFM-table clip fix above, a `motion-reduce`
guard on the shared dropdown primitive, and a full-suite regression (chip's governance RPC unmocked in the
Team-approval render test). **MERGED to `main` (squash `22a12b7b`, PR #1008); frontend ships via the Vercel
production build — no migration/edge deploy for this commit.**

**Main Paige Operational Chat — capability truth + the contact vertical + the reusable contact.created event (PR #1145, merging 2026-09-12).** The owner-mandated program (make the authenticated Solo Main Paige chat a truthful, governed COO-level operating conversation on the EXISTING Harness/Spine/Rail/receipts/Binding-Ledger — no new architecture). Shipped increments, honest deploy state:
- **Truthful capability awareness — LIVE (edge).** A new `capability_status` chat read tool: before Paige claims a capability she consults a server-resolved, tenant-scoped truth (pure resolver `_shared/paige-capability-status/{resolver,signals,render}.ts`) composing tier × owner-ops role × autonomy-lane × Spine maturity × connection/provider state into ONE honest availability per capability, most-restrictive-wins. Deploys live via the edge pipeline on merge (uses only already-live prod RPCs — `resolve_tool_autonomy`, the Spine registry). Authenticated owner-drive §32.c OWED.
  - **2026-09-12 manifest completion (Chat Product Completion, Slice 1, branch `claude/paige-cowork-handoff-rpf6dw`).** The manifest scope widened from contacts+connections to the full honest picture the owner reaches from the cockpit. **Anti-UNDER-claim additions** (previously silent, genuinely governed chat tools, each grounded in its REAL ceiling-clamped lane): `documents.create`, `knowledge.save`, `planning.create`, `agentteam.delegate` (the §8 "hire her team" capability), and `research.web` (a read gated on the REAL `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` presence — verified to match `paige-web-search`/`paige-deep-research`'s own `configured` degrade, so research reads `needs_setup` exactly when the tool would degrade, `live` exactly when it runs; §13/§34 names-not-values). **Anti-OVER-claim additions** (honest UNAVAILABLE → "planned", the safe direction): `skills.run` (no skill tool in this chat; library lives in MCP + the admin Skills Hub only) and `browser.secure_session` (request boundary ships, worker gated off, no chat entry). **Two new dispositions** extend the resolver vocabulary to the owner's full taxonomy: `proof_owed` (a built-but-fails-closed path — Paige may attempt but never promises the result) and `no_applicable_capability` (request matches none — named in the render directive so Paige says so plainly, never invents a tool). Also re-added the `integrations.n8n_run_workflow` signal (it had been dropped in an earlier rewrite while its facts were still passed). Pure-core + gatherer wiring only — no new table, authority engine, or tool; the decision core is unchanged (§18, adding a capability = adding a signal). Grounding artifact: `docs/delivery/chat-completion-matrix.md`. Authenticated owner-drive §32.c still OWED (the universal proof gate: least-privilege Solo test tenant + `LIVE_DRIVE_*` secrets).
  - **2026-09-13 durable task↔thread link hardened (Chat Product Completion, Slice 2, same branch).** The chat-completion-matrix family-1 "Durable tasking (task↔thread link): PARTIAL — no chat tool proven to set it e2e" is now a TRUSTED, validated link. `crm_create_task` had stamped `tasks.source_thread_id` from the raw client body `threadId` via a service-role insert (RLS bypassed), with no check the thread was the caller's — a §9 integrity hole (a client could record another tenant's conversation as a task's provenance; not a transcript leak, since a dangling uuid grants no read). Now the claim is VALIDATED server-side as the caller's OWN thread in the RESOLVED tenant (RLS read on the caller-JWT client, filtered `id`+`tenant_id`+`caller_user_id`) before stamping; foreign/forged/expired/absent (and account-switched) → `NULL`. Decision rule in one home `_shared/source-thread-link.ts` (§18); no new DEFINER (§59 — an RLS read); no second registry; link = traceability only, never completion proof (§13). Proven by a pure-helper unit test (6 owner scenarios), a source-assertion wiring test, and a SET-ROLE RLS proof (`supabase/tests/source_thread_link_scope.sql`, wired into the `database-contract` CI job): same-tenant validate / cross-tenant denial / account-switch denial / no-discovery. Authenticated owner-drive §32.c OWED.
- **Honest contact-create + stable idempotency — LIVE (edge).** `crm_create_contact` now distinguishes created vs already-existed (migration `create_contact_v2`), records the per-client Rail ONLY on a genuine insert (the §947 false-"created" fix), and a stable idempotency key (`stableRunId`) means a retry folds to ONE capability-run row. **NOTE:** the `create_contact_v2` migration (`20270118000000`) is MERGED but its prod apply is deploy-pending behind #1147 (see below) — the chat's honest-outcome logic is edge-live, the RETURNS-TABLE signal lands on prod when the migration applies.
- **The reusable `contact.created` native-event bus — MERGED, prod-migration deploy PENDING #1147.** A durable, tenant-safe event bus (`paige_native_events` outbox + atomic claim ledger; `paige_event_dispatches` per-subscriber fire-once ledger; an AFTER-INSERT-on-`clients` transactional-outbox producer; the `paige-native-event-dispatch` service/cron edge drainer; a `pg_cron` sweeper; a `get_contact_event_status` SECURITY-INVOKER read RPC + a `contact_event_status` chat tool so Paige reports delivery truthfully). EXTENDS §67 (subscribers are `paige_automations` by `trigger_key`) and MIRRORS the proven growth durable-delivery pattern (§18). §9 tenant-scoped, §59 service-only claim RPCs; reviewed by the §39 adversarial + §5 compliance passes (no blockers; reliability/honesty findings folded). SCOPE (§13/§947): substrate + fire-once delivery only — NO subscriber-act execution, NO external send (Telegram stays off until its security design lands); each dispatch records `delivered:true, acts_executed:false`. **Its migration (`20270119000000`) sorts after #1147 in the prod deploy queue, so its prod activation is blocked until the Social workstream fixes #1147** (`20270117000000` indexes `paige_social_posts(tenant_id)`, a column absent on that table — a replay/deploy break, issue #1147, owner-directed not-this-program's). The edge code deploys but is inert until the tables land. Hardening fast-follows (dead-letter visibility, retention, a zombie-claimed edge, the act-execution + conditions gate) tracked in #1149. NOT live on prod until #1147 lands + the authenticated owner-drive (§32.c/§70).

### Sandboxed Research & External Execution — a COMPONENT of the Paige Capability System (above); APPROVED MVP DIRECTION (owner-directed 2026-09-05; a DECISION, NOT a live capability)

Owner-directed MVP capability so Paige is an active AI COO/orchestrator, not a chat interface that
describes what to do. **This is an approved DIRECTION + dependency-ordered plan — no sandbox is "live"
because a design or handler exists (§13/§32/§70).** Full plan + honest state labels + file:line grounding:
`outputs/paige-at-cowork/08-sandboxed-research-external-execution.md`. Operating model: PAIGE is the
governed decision layer; native tools operate inside the tenant platform; n8n/Zapier/MCP/future
integrations are **controlled external workers, never a bypass** around authority/tenant-isolation/
approvals/outcome-recording; a **sandbox** is the contained workbench for untrusted/generated-code/
browser/file/external execution — not a replacement for Paige or the governed tool system.

**The honest state split (grounded by four read-only scouts, 2026-09-05):**
- **Research half — largely LIVE/PARTIAL, harden+reach not build (§18).** `deep_research` (a real
  multi-hop engine with a hard anti-fabrication citation gate) and `web_search` are LIVE Paige-chat
  tools; the `browse_public_url` skill + the SSRF-hardened `paige-browser` Fly service ship with the
  tenant-scoped `paige_browser_usage` audit rail (§32.a confirmed; §32.c live-drive OWED). Public
  browsing blocks **Paige-DRIVEN** writes (login/submit/click/download steps rejected by the allowlist);
  a visited page's own JS could still POST to a public host (the `page.route` interceptor gates host/SSRF
  only, not HTTP method — a named **G5** hardening gap, Codex P1 2026-09-05), so it is **PARTIAL on the
  no-external-write axis, NOT read-only-by-construction**. `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` config-gating +
  DNS-rebinding (#138) + the two unequal SSRF guards are the other named PARTIAL/PROOF-OWED gaps.
- **Sandbox half — genuinely GREENFIELD/UNAVAILABLE.** An exhaustive grep found **no untrusted-execution
  sandbox** (the only "sandboxes" are the two read-only Fly Playwright services; Browserbase is an inert
  stub). Governing worker **downstream** actions is also UNAVAILABLE — `delegate_to_subagent` runs the
  orchestrator as service-role and the specialist acts outside the risk gate; `paige-mcp` enforces
  tier+scope but no approval/risk gate; the `decideGovernedExecution` seam exists as a pure module,
  unwired. Per-worker network isolation, budget/cost + Trust-Compass consult on the execution path
  (why `trigger-workflow` is fail-closed disabled), and recurring-autonomous scheduling are all PLANNED.

**Five dependency-ordered slices:** (1) browser research MVP [LIVE/PARTIAL — harden+reach] → (2) governed
worker dispatch [PARTIAL — unify the gate across regimes + govern downstream] → (3) sandboxed file/code/data
work [UNAVAILABLE/greenfield] → (4) advanced browser automation [UNAVAILABLE; only via the governed action
path] → (5) recurring autonomous [PLANNED; governed by §67/§68, cloud-native §64]. Every meaningful
external/sandboxed action records a safe attributable Rail outcome (reuse `capability-record.ts`, 6
outcomes); Spine/Mind retain only scoped sourced facts (F02 Memory contract — handoff dep). **Same-slice
refresh discipline (owner-directed):** at each completed slice this record updates with what shipped, exact
evidence, what remains UNAVAILABLE/proof-owed, the next owning workstream, and any dependency-order change.

**Secure Browser / Twin Phase-0 audit (2026-09-06; owner-ruled 2026-09-07) — a DIRECTION, not a live capability.** A read-only
current-main + deployed-state audit of the "Paige Secure Browser / Twin" direction confirms the state
above against live code: public research is **LIVE/PARTIAL** (`deep_research`/`web_search` reachable in
chat; `browse_public_url` skill PARTIAL, flag-gated + G5); the **credentialed** modes (owner-assisted
sign-in with MFA handoff, connected-accounts) are **UNAVAILABLE**; there is **no in-chat live browser
window**; and **no browser provider is wired** (Browserbase = inert/undeployed stub; **neither "Twin"
product is wired** — and "Twin" is TWO distinct vendors: **twin.so** (Twin Labs SAS, Paris) has REST /
no-MCP / no shipped vault, while the "vault + MCP" material belongs to **twin-browser.com**, a *separate*
product whose **legal operator is undisclosed** and whose **domain is ~10 weeks old** (2026-06-24,
redacted WHOIS) — a due-diligence red flag, not attributable to Twin Labs). The full packet — collision map vs the five slices above, current-state
matrix, provider evaluation (Browserbase/Anchor/Steel/Twin), three-mode security architecture, Phase 0–4
roadmap, and Phase-1 security/flow plan — is `docs/audits/paige-secure-browser-audit-2026-09-06.md`.
**Owner ruling (2026-09-07):** custody model = **owner-direct login + provider-held persistent session**
(Paige stores only an opaque provider/context reference + allowed host/action scope + authority /
freshness / revocation state + receipts; the raw password never transits Paige); **Browserbase** adopted
as the **`PROPOSED`** Phase-1 candidate pending the provider-contract / privacy / data-residency /
security / price / integration review. **No provider is wired and nothing installs until that review
completes.** The credentialed modes must ride the §10 Standing Delegated Authority Contract + §68, not a
new autonomy system.

**Product correction (owner, 2026-09-07):** Paige Secure Browser is a **Paige-OWNED** capability — Paige
owns the in-chat UI, policy layer, browser control plane, tenant isolation, Vault **Connected Accounts**
(owner-managed, tenant-isolated, revocable, auditable, never casually readable by Paige), audit history,
action receipts, and reusable browser skills. **Browserbase is only a REPLACEABLE bootstrap runtime for the
isolated browser WORKER**, behind a **provider-neutral internal Secure Browser contract** so Paige can
progressively run her own Chromium/Playwright fleet — no provider API/MCP/branding/styling/data-model may
leak into customer UI or core domain contracts (customer feature = "Paige Secure Browser"/"Secure Browser").
Downloads/captured files → **Vault quarantine**. The `browserbase` registry entry is now `PROPOSED` (the
worker runtime, replaceable) — updated in the audit PR. A dedicated **build handoff** (owner-complete in-chat
UI flow FIRST, then backend) follows the MVP plan. **Both now written (2026-09-07):**
`docs/delivery/paige-secure-browser-mvp-plan.md` (the phased MVP) and
`docs/handoff/paige-secure-browser-build-handoff.md` (the exact builder spec). Still no install —
Phase 0 exit is the owner's Browserbase-worker provider review.

**Phase-0 exit — #1037 merged + Browserbase worker-provider review = CONDITIONAL GO (2026-09-07, owner-authorized).**
Owner approved #1037 → merged to `main` (squash `0a4ef0b`, CI green). Owner reported Browserbase account
provisioned + `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` stored as an Edge secret — **infrastructure readiness ONLY, not
authorization to wire, and the secret value is never revealed/logged/rotated/tested (§34)**. The Phase-0
Browserbase worker-provider desk review (read-only public materials; no account/login/API/session/crawl) is
`docs/audits/paige-secure-browser-provider-review-browserbase-2026-09-07.md`, with the dedicated-builder
kickoff at `docs/handoff/paige-secure-browser-builder-starting-packet.md`. **Verdict: CONDITIONAL GO** —
Browserbase as the replaceable bootstrap browser-**worker** behind the provider-neutral internal contract;
strong technical/contract fit (every internal op maps to a documented primitive; Contexts custody = "no raw
credentials submitted"). **Credentialed wiring is gated on SEVEN owner-side vendor gates:** (1) NDA docs (SOC 2
Type II report + HIPAA BAA on our tier + DPA no-training/erasure + subprocessor list/US); (2) spend bounding
(vendor states "No caps. No cut-offs" → committed ceiling OR Paige-side per-tenant minute budget + concurrency
cap + usage polling); (3) Live-View debug-URL security; (4) Context authorization / no cross-key replay; (5) US
region pin (per-session, not project-locked); (6) Zero-Data-Retention mechanics (per-session flag); (7) deletion
SLA + endpoints. **The GO authorizes building now:** the Paige-owned UI + control plane + provider-neutral
contract + read-only Phase-1 worker path (flagged OFF) + the audit §4.3 security prerequisites. **It does NOT
authorize:** account use, credential, live session, real Context, or tenant connect — those wait on the seven
gates. Drive the REST API, not the thin MCP server. `browserbase` registry entry stays `PROPOSED` with the
CONDITIONAL-GO dependency + 7 gates recorded.

**Dedicated-builder security prerequisite candidate (2026-09-07; not yet merged/deployed).** Current
`main` was re-grounded at `49d25f4c`; #1039 is merged and its provider review/starting packet is
preserved. Candidate source makes `browser_use_sessions.tenant_id` non-null, enforces same-tenant
related objects even for service-role writers, locks two unattributable historical failed rows in
quarantine, authenticates before tenant/contact reads, and preserves truthful admin/agency/MCP
provenance. The provider execution branch is removed and the endpoint can only record a safe failed
`secure_worker_under_setup` request. G5 is closed in both Playwright routes with hostile-page
Chromium proof; production migration replay passed inside `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`. This is automated and
rollback evidence only: merge, deployment, authenticated, and rendered proof remain owed; credentialed
Secure Browser remains **UNAVAILABLE**; Browserbase remains `PROPOSED`, unwired, and gated by all
seven vendor conditions. No approved Solo Claude Design/Flow Prototype pack exists on current
`main`, so the UI-first build is **BLOCKED** at the visual-contract boundary and no production pixels
were invented. Detailed action receipts, budgets/concurrency, session lifecycle controls, Vault
download ingress, and Connected Accounts remain unbuilt.

### Solo n8n connection clarity — historical UI slice, 2026-09-03

The owner approved separate API connection and Paige tools (MCP) tabs and independent tile/overview states. This earlier UI slice preserved stored credentials while OAuth was blocked. Superseded by released PR #909: standard OAuth is live with the owner-accepted gateway logging risk; only final owner consent/provider verification remains Proof Owed. Current API saved status/count/timestamp does not prove fresh health; the UI must not claim it does. No callback, backend credential, tool-authority, workflow execution, Chat or Spine changes are included. Delivery and proof: `docs/delivery/solo-n8n-connection-clarity.md`. Authenticated owner acceptance is recorded separately from automated/build/deployment evidence.

### Solo n8n API save-and-check completion — 2026-09-03

Owner-authorized follow-up completes one API drawer journey: securely save or replace the key, validate read-only workflow inventory, display verified health/count/check time, and reconnect on refusal. New caller-scoped readiness and service-side revision/attempt fences prevent legacy saved status or stale validation from claiming health. Existing encryption is reused; no credential is replaced by deployment. API visibility and MCP authority remain independent. That earlier API-only slice made no OAuth change. PR #909 subsequently released OAuth separately; API visibility remains independent and no bearer fallback is offered. Proof: `docs/delivery/solo-n8n-api-completion.md`; authenticated owner/provider acceptance remains separate from synthetic runtime, database, and deployment checks.
The API feedback follow-up masks prior evidence while checking or uncertain, shares current API status between tile/drawer, and makes optional owner Refresh status run validation. Reopened server checks settle through bounded readiness polling. The safe Integration-to-Spine summary is a proposal only; no downstream wiring or authority is included. See `docs/delivery/solo-n8n-validation-feedback.md`.

### Solo Notifications menu retirement — 2026-09-03

The standalone Solo Notifications destination is retired with a same-account replace redirect to Setup and a one-arrival acknowledgement. Billing retains its source-owned designations and no-sender disclosure; its badge now says “Designated for billing notices.” All other source controls remain unchanged. See `docs/delivery/solo-contextual-notifications-retirement.md` for collision scope, source mapping, tests and Proof Owed. Backend containment #896 is already deployed and catalog/source-verified; no production notification records were used as proof.

### Platform notification permission repair — 2026-09-03

Owner-scoped follow-up to released #883: operator-only SELECT and read_at UPDATE on the legacy platform notification store; remove excessive anonymous/authenticated privileges and all four legacy permissive policies. A restrictive operator boundary prevents permissive-policy reintroduction from admitting tenants. The table remains outside realtime publication (confirmed current production metadata); source producers and service-role privileges remain unchanged. No production notification records are read, seeded, updated or deleted for proof.

The owner additionally authorized exactly `list_admin_notifications` and `create_admin_notification` in `paige-mcp`: operator-only discovery and invocation, generic refusal before privileged notification access, no named denial audit, existing operator scopes preserved. No other MCP tool changes. #4's same-file environment renames do not overlap these hunks. Branch: `codex/platform-notification-permissions`.

Proof: actual MCP gate/discovery execution with synthetic actors; isolated PostgreSQL role simulations (tenant/global admin/coach refusal, both operator roles allowed, update column limits, no publication, service-role insert preserved, migration applied twice). CI repeats the fixture on PostgreSQL 17. Production verification is catalog/function-definition evidence only, not a live exploit. Signed-in owner walkthrough remains Proof Owed. Sender/producer authorization is explicitly not repaired by this slice; adjacent static concerns in `platform-independence-sweep` and `notify-approval-event` remain source-owner security follow-ups, not permission to edit their behavior here.

### Solo platform-bell containment — 2026-09-03

Owner-authorized scoped security patch: the canonical tenant header no longer imports or mounts `AdminBridgeBell`. The retained platform header bell and legacy `/admin/notifications` page are wrapped in the existing server-verifying `RequireOperator` guard. No notification records, source components, senders, policies, or recipient models are changed. This is UI reachability containment, not database-policy remediation: **static authorization defect confirmed / production data exposure unverified**. No production notification contents were inspected.

Scope: `TenantCommandCenterShell.tsx`, `AdminLayout.tsx`, the notifications route in `Admin.tsx`, and narrow regression tests. Current-main collision check found no overlapping containment hunk; PR #724's shared Admin file changes concern shell takeover, which this patch preserves. Settings menu/redirect work is a separate slice. Tests cover forbidden tenant imports, guard ordering, pending authority, tenant refusal, verified operator access, and subject-change cleanup; existing operator/shell suites cover adjacent transitions. Authenticated production pathway and viewport proof remain Proof Owed until exercised; automated results do not establish production data exposure or database denial.

No replacement Solo inbox is introduced. A future Attention surface requires tenant-safe source-backed summaries. Platform-wide delivery remains operator-owned; Billing contacts, Team outcomes, connection health, Security, Sales and Client Portal contracts remain with their respective source owners.

### Billing Foundation C — the Solo Billing screen (PR #833, **RELEASED — merged `11997dac` 2026-09-03; no production write of any kind**)

**What it is.** Foundation A shipped three seams and no renderer; nothing in `src/` imported the two
hooks and no surface called `get_workspace_billing_authority()`. Foundation C mounts them at
`Solo Settings › Billing`.

**The correction.** The pre-C tab read `get_tenant_platform_subscription()`, joined it to the plan
CATALOGUE and rendered `Solo · Active · $149.00/month · Renews 5 Aug 2027` for every workspace.
Queried on prod 2026-09-03 (ref `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`): all four live `platform_subscriptions` rows
carry a NULL `stripe_customer_id` **and** a NULL `stripe_subscription_id`; three are `test_seed:
true`, the fourth `revenue_class: promotional` / `provider_state: not_created`. **The catalogue is a
price list, not a charge, and a seeded period end is not a renewal.** The catalogue is no longer an
input to the screen, and a test walks every state reachable **without an entitlement projection**
(which is every state reachable today) and fails on any `$` in the output.

**The state machine** is `src/solo/billing-contract.ts`, over the Gate-1 approved vocabulary
(packet §9.1) with three additions and four disclosed deviations. Promotional / trial / paid need an
entitlement record that proves them; "Choose a plan" needs a successful read that returned
`source: none`; every unavailable carries one of five distinct causes. **The entitlement projection
is Foundation B** (packet §4.3 R11), so today every top-level Solo workspace resolves to
`billing-unavailable · no_billing_account` — never a promotional grant (R13).

**What an owner can now finish (§70.1):** designate the workspace's primary billing contact, add and
remove a billing delegate, reload and find it held. R27 is stated on the surface (a designation is
not ownership); so is the fact that no notice is sent, because no sender exists.

**Reviewed independently three times (§39/§5), and it mattered.** Eight findings, five of them
defects live on a pushed head: a failed roster read rendered as "this workspace has nobody
eligible"; a write outcome survived a workspace switch; an unrecognised mapping state fell
**through** the guards into "this workspace has a billing account" plus an enabled Manage-billing
button; the same mapping fix was left half-applied on the portal card's copy; and the shared harness
store had no migration. Two doctrine findings: the shipped **"Usage & limits"** card had been
deleted with no call-out (**§58 — restored**), and **R22 was half-held** — `can_view_billing` was
consumed nowhere, harmless then and a leak the moment Foundation B supplies a price, so the plan
card now refuses a non-viewing Solo member.

**Evidence:** 71 new tests; full suite 179 files / 2334 tests; `ci:tsc` ratchet unchanged at 13;
build green; **116/116 rendered checks** across 4 viewports × 2 palettes plus the failed-read and
read-only worlds. **Release status: `PARTIAL` / `Authenticated Runtime Proof Owed`.**

**OWED (post-release audit backlog, `docs/delivery/billing-foundation-c-design.md` §9):** the
authenticated owner drive on the deployed surface (§32.c); a **Gate-1 pass on the billing-contacts
card**, which the approved prototype does not cover (§00 — CC does not fill a gap in the pack); a
§57 divergence, since Settings › Connections still renders "Solo plan · LIVE" from the catalogue
join this slice disqualifies; the now-dead `useSoloComms().billing` fetch; `plan-beta` collapsed
into `plan-current`; and `past_due` having no approved wording.

**Untouched:** the portal flag (off), every Stripe object, `platform_subscriptions`, the catalogue,
Foundation B, and every shared module outside `src/solo/`.

**Boundary correction, owner 2026-09-03 (post-release).** The "What you charge your clients" pointer
card has **moved off Billing to Campaigns → Sales**. The owner's rule: *"Billing is for us, our
platform billing the tenant"* — client billing is the other direction of money and belongs on the
tenant's own commercial surface (§38 / §197 LAYER 2). *Invoices & payment method* was deliberately
**not** moved: those are the tenant's invoices FROM Paige, which is platform billing by that same
definition. Billing now renders four cards.

**Second boundary correction, owner 2026-09-03.** *"Invoices & payment method"* is renamed
**"Payment method"**. Owner's reason: *"I don't think we're going to be accepting invoices or sending
people invoices. Invoices are an option that they send to their customers. Payment Method is what we
want on their account when we're billing them."* The card's title, body and every refusal state stop
claiming invoices. `platform_invoices` remains in the schema with no writer and is now surfaced by
nothing.

### Billing — AI usage allowance (PR #854, **MERGED `03d85474` 2026-09-03**)

**§13 correction (2026-09-03):** this heading said "NOT MERGED" — stale from before #854 merged,
caught while writing the entry below for #865. Corrected rather than left to mislead the next
reader.

**Owner ruling 2026-09-03.** Use the EXISTING `platform_usage_events` as the AI-usage source of
truth; do not build a parallel meter and do not misuse `platform_metered_events`, which belongs to a
different pass-through layer. Solo: **5,000 AI credits/month = 5,000,000 server-recorded tokens.**
Agency: **15,000 credits = 15,000,000 tokens.** **One AI credit is 1,000 tokens**, stated plainly
anywhere credits appear.

**Visibility only.** No workspace shutdown, no degraded product, no automatic overage, no surprise
charge. Exhausting the allowance changes nothing, and the card says so. Eventual enforcement belongs
at the action-bus policy clamp (§67), never in the Billing screen.

**All current workspaces are promotional during beta.** The card is labelled "Promotional AI usage
tracking" and does NOT represent promotional usage as revenue-backed paid-plan entitlement, nor imply
the $74.50 beta price supports this cost model. The revenue class is read from its own explicit
record; an unclassified workspace is never inferred to be promotional (R13).

**What shipped on the branch.** (1) The allowance and the credit ratio on
`platform_subscription_plans`, NULL-together or set-together under a CHECK, with enterprise
deliberately NULL — a custom quote, never a zero that reads as "nothing included". (2)
`get_workspace_ai_usage()`: no argument, workspace server-derived, Owner-only (R22), counting ONLY
`event_type = 'llm_tokens'` inside a period taken from a real subscription when one exists and
otherwise reported as `calendar_month`. Every current workspace carries a seeded 2027
`current_period_end` with a NULL Stripe subscription id, so presenting that as a billing period would
have repeated exactly the fabrication Foundation C removed. (3) The Billing card, upgraded in place
from `UNAVAILABLE` (**§58** — it was never removed).

**Two premises the database taught us, now asserted as properties.** The proof was REFUSED twice, and
both refusals were correct. `trg_ensure_tenant_revenue_classification` already writes a
`'promotional'` row for every new tenant — so "a workspace with no classification record" cannot arise
from provisioning at all, making that arm of the resolver defensive rather than expected. And `'paid'`
is a **gated mint**: owner + signed subscriber agreement + live provider subscription, enforced by
`enforce_revenue_integrity_chain`; the proof's first fixture ordering wrote the class before the
subscription it requires. Both are now P36/P37 so a future reader who "tidies" the ordering gets a
failing check rather than a confusing error.

**Per-workspace AI COST is deliberately not shown, on any tier.** `paige_llm_trace` reports an
`est_usd_total` of $4.88 across 697 calls, but **632 of them (91%) carry no cost at all** — a floor of
unknown distance from the truth, and a floor on a Billing screen is a wrong number on a Billing
screen. Better cost attribution is an internal operator-observability slice, sequenced AFTER
tenant-facing usage truth is live.

**Evidence.** Migration proven against production inside `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` — **26/26 properties, 0
failures, nothing persisted** (verified after: zero leftover fixtures, columns and function absent on
prod). 39 new tests; `160/160` rendered harness checks across 4 viewports × 2 palettes plus the
failed-read and read-only worlds. **Status: `PARTIAL` / `Authenticated Runtime Proof Owed`** — the
harness transport is a stub (§32.c), and the migration's **persisted-apply confirmation is owed on
merge** (§32.a).

**Deliberately NOT in this slice:** plan changes, plan upsert, Stripe mapping, provider portal
activation, automatic overage, enforcement, and usage-threshold notification SENDING (records and
readiness only; nothing is sent until a delivery system exists and is separately authorized).

### Billing Experience — truthful account status, items 1–3 (PR #865, **MERGED `5ae7a34a` 2026-09-03; migrations persisted-apply confirmed on production**)

**§32.a, checked after merge, not assumed.** `schema_migrations` on prod carries `20261109040000`,
`20261111050000`, `20261120000000`; `get_workspace_billing_status()`, the 7 `payment_method_*`
columns, and `trg_platform_billing_one_primary` all confirmed to exist by direct query. Mogul Maker
Academy's real tenant row shows 2 live primary billing contacts right now — the Selection-needed
banner this PR ships is not a fixture scenario, it fires for the real workspace it was built for.

**Owner brief 2026-09-03, continuing from the approved Slice A proof (`cb2f5b79`).** *"A promotional
workspace with no billing-provider mapping is not 'billing unavailable.' It is a valid promotional
account with $0 due today."* This slice replaces the mapping-gated plan resolver — which could only
ever show `billing-unavailable`, because Foundation B's entitlement projection did not exist — with
`get_workspace_billing_status()`, a real, single, Owner-only read of what the workspace actually
receives.

**Three DB slices, each found-and-fixed a real defect, each proven separately on production inside
`BEGIN..ROLLBACK` (29/29, 9/9, 4/4; nothing persisted):**
- **Slice A** (`20261109040000`, part of THIS PR's own branch history, NOT a prior separate merge —
  **§13 correction, independent review, PR #865**: this entry originally said "already on main",
  which was wrong) — one live primary billing contact per workspace
  going forward; the sole-primary revoke guard un-hitched from Stripe (it had required a
  `stripe_customer_id`, which no workspace has, making the guard permanently inert); the first
  `get_workspace_billing_status()`.
- **Slice B** (`20261111050000`) — Slice A's own function read provider mapping from
  `platform_subscriptions.stripe_customer_id`, which the real checkout flow never populates.
  Corrected to read `platform_billing_accounts`, the same table `get_workspace_billing_authority()`
  already reads, via the same ambiguity helper. Adds payment-method columns (brand/last4/exp),
  written only by `stripe-webhook`, never by any future connect function.
- **Slice C** (`20261120000000`) — every top-level tenant (parent_tenant_id IS NULL) was classified
  `scope='top_level'`, including Agency/Enterprise. Corrected via the same `account_type`
  discriminant `platform_billing_account_top_level_guard` already enforces. Found by re-reading the
  sibling guard function before wiring the frontend to the read, not by a report.

**Frontend, items 1–3 of the brief's build order.** The plan card now sources from the corrected
read: heading `{workspace}'s PAIGE Plan & Usage`, `Billed by PAIGE Platform`, the real amount due
(`$0` for promotional, never invented for anything else), whether payment setup is required — with
provider-account existence and payment method shown as a SEPARATE labelled fact, never gating the
access claim (the exact bug the rebuild exists to correct). Item 2: `ContactsCard` renders a
distinct **Selection needed** banner when the server reports `primary_selection_needed` — the real
state Mogul Maker Academy is in (two live primaries from before Slice A's trigger existed); the
banner names that an owner must choose, the platform never chooses silently. Item 3: seats/contacts
usage from the same real read; SMS shown only when a real meter exists (it does not, so it is
omitted — never a fabricated zero); paid marketplace add-ons shown only when the count is real and
nonzero.

**A real bug caught by the new tests, before merge.** The field-builder helpers
(`providerFieldsFrom`, `usageFieldsFrom`) built `[string,string]` tuples against a
`{label,value}` object return type. TypeScript did not flag it — every field silently rendered as
empty text. The new tests for the provider-readiness and usage fields failed for exactly this
reason; fixed to build object literals, same PR.

**PortalCard (the "Manage billing" hosted-portal act), `useWorkspaceBillingAuthority`, and
`useWorkspaceBillingContacts` are UNCHANGED** — Foundation A already reads the correct mapping table
for the portal, so that path stays as-is.

**Not in this PR, sequenced next per the brief's own ordering** ("Build the owner-only payment setup
flow after the status page is complete"): item 4 (live payment-method connection — a new
`platform-billing-connect` edge function, owner-click-only, setup-mode Stripe Checkout Session that
never charges, plus a new discriminated block in `stripe-webhook`) and item 5 (a tenant-safe,
server-resolved billing summary for Spine).

**A real deploy-blocking defect, caught twice, independently, and fixed before merge.**
`database-contract` CI (a full sequential migration replay) failed on `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
get_workspace_billing_status()` in Slice B: `42P13 "cannot change return type of existing
function"`, because Slice B inserts 5 new `payment_method_*` columns into the MIDDLE of Slice A's
column list, and Postgres refuses to REPLACE a function whose `RETURNS TABLE` row type changed —
only a `DROP FUNCTION` first, or appending new columns strictly at the end, is legal. None of the
`BEGIN..ROLLBACK` proofs could catch this: each slice's proof only `\i`s its own migration file, so
`CREATE OR REPLACE` always acted as a fresh `CREATE` against a name that had never existed in that
isolated transaction — the conflict only exists when Slice A has genuinely run first. Fixed with a
`DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` immediately before Slice B's `CREATE OR REPLACE`. Independently confirmed
by BOTH CI (which failed, then passed after the fix) AND the Agent-based adversarial review
(substituting for Codex, see below), which reproduced the identical error against a local Postgres
16 install before the fix was known to it, and separately named the exact same root cause. A new
regression property (C1) was added to `scripts/sql/billing-status-payment-method-proof.sql` that
creates Slice A's original column shape first, then `\i`s the real Slice B file, so this class of
bug fails the proof again if it recurs.

**Evidence.** Slice A 29/29, Slice B 10/10 (including C1, the sequential-apply regression above,
and C5, which reproduces the exact old-table bug shape before asserting the fix), Slice C 4/4 — all
production `BEGIN..ROLLBACK`, nothing persisted. Frontend: 93 tests in the two touched files,
1143/1143 across `src/solo/`; typecheck and lint clean. **Status: `PARTIAL` / `Authenticated
Runtime Proof Owed`** — no browser-driving tool in this session (§32.c); the migrations'
persisted-apply confirmation is also owed on merge (§32.a). Independent review: Codex was reported
unavailable at review time; an Agent-based adversarial review was substituted per explicit owner
instruction, found the deploy-blocking defect above (already fixed by the time of this entry) plus
a stale JSDoc header on `settings-billing.tsx` (fixed) and a migration comment overclaiming a
webhook writer that does not exist yet (fixed to future tense), and Codex review is to resume when
it returns.

### Billing Experience — payment-method connect + Spine evidence, items 4–5 (PR #870, **MERGED `cdea70ae` 2026-09-03; migrations persisted-apply confirmed on production**)

**2026-09-03 P0 correction — FAIL / repair in progress.** The authenticated owner attempt failed before hosted setup. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is present; missing-secret speculation is superseded. The repair candidate removes card fields from the Solo response, binds delayed client work to workspace/actor, requests cards explicitly and uses atomic retryable webhook persistence without selecting an invoice default. Prior paragraphs below describe the historical release, not verified provider completion. [Current repair and separated proof ledger](delivery/billing-payment-setup-p0.md).


**Continuation of the row above**, built on the fresh branch off #865's merged `main`, per the
owner's explicit item-4/item-5 brief, authorized through PR/merge/deploy/production verification
without a routine approval pause.

**Item 4 — owner-only payment-method connection.** New edge function `platform-billing-connect`:
Owner-only, `top_level`-scope-only (mirrors `decidePortalAccess`'s gate exactly, with one
deliberate difference — it allows `billing_account_state: "absent"` as well as `"mapped"`, since
connect is how a mapping first comes to exist). On explicit owner click only, opens a Stripe
Checkout Session in `mode: "setup"` — a SetupIntent, never a charge, subscription, or plan
mutation. No external Stripe customer or provider object is created on page load, deploy,
migration, background reconciliation, or a test — only on that click, and the Customer create is
idempotent (`pbc_customer_${tenantId}`) so a retry never mints a second one. The Checkout return is
handled by a new discriminated block in the existing `stripe-webhook` (keyed on
`session.metadata.platform_billing_connect_tenant_id`), which resolves the SetupIntent's
PaymentMethod and writes brand/last4/exp via a new shared writer `upsertPaymentMethod()` — a
customer-id mismatch between the webhook event and the tenant's own mapping row is refused, nothing
written, following the same conflict discipline as the existing `upsertBillingAccount()`.
**Deliberately not in this slice: payment-method removal.** No removal seam exists in the current
provider wiring; building one safely is separate design work, scoped out honestly per the brief's
own "record the exact reason as Proof Owed or follow-up" allowance rather than dropped silently.

**Item 5 — `get_billing_spine_evidence()` (`20261140000000`).** Built entirely on
`get_workspace_billing_status()` (§18 — never a second computation of the same facts), in the exact
fixed-field contract `get_pipeline_spine_evidence()` established. Answers Spine's five listed
questions (plan/promotional status, anything due, payment-setup readiness, the primary billing
contact if the caller is the owner, measured usage, whether owner action is needed) and structurally
excludes every forbidden category — no Stripe id, no card brand/last4/expiry, no invoice payload, no
internal cost estimate, no cross-workspace or sales/client-payment data — because none of those
fields exist on the function it reads from, so there is nothing in reach to accidentally select.
`SECURITY DEFINER`, `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC, ANON, SERVICE_ROLE; GRANT EXECUTE TO AUTHENTICATED`; a
non-owner, sub-account, or Agency/Enterprise caller gets zero rows, never a guess (R22).

**Evidence.** Backend: `deno check` clean, `deno test` 28/28. Frontend: `tsc --noEmit` clean,
1215/1215 across `src/solo/` (9 new payment-setup-act cases), `eslint` clean on every changed `src/`
file. **Production rollback proof, 14/14, 0 failures, nothing persisted** — including P11/P12, which
prove `get_billing_spine_evidence()` correctly reads `owner_action_needed=true` with the real
dual-primary reason for a genuine two-live-primary workspace; the fixture recreates that historical
state by disabling `trg_platform_billing_one_primary` (the #865 Slice A trigger, permanently live on
prod) for exactly the two inserts that reconstruct MMA's own pre-trigger pair, then re-enabling it
before the migration under proof runs — the same shape of state the trigger tolerates, never one it
was bypassed to create going forward.

**§32.a, checked after merge, not assumed.** Queried directly against prod (ref
`xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`): `schema_migrations` carries `20261140000000`;
`get_billing_spine_evidence()` exists in `pg_proc` with `prosecdef=true` and the declared grant
shape confirmed by `has_function_privilege()` (`authenticated=true`, `anon=false`,
`service_role=false`). Both edge functions are `ACTIVE` on prod: `platform-billing-connect` (new,
v1) and `stripe-webhook` (v53, carrying the new payment-method-connect block).

**Status: `PARTIAL` / `Authenticated Runtime Proof Owed`** — no browser-driving tool in this
session (§32.c): the shared-writer unit tests prove real Stripe SetupIntent/PaymentMethod retrieval
logic, but a live click-through of "Set up payment method" → Stripe-hosted Checkout → return →
confirmation banner has not been driven end-to-end and remains owed to the next capable session.

**Cross-reference.** PR #869 (`claude/spine-billing-packet`, a different session, merged just
before this one) audited the OLDER `get_workspace_billing_authority()` contract for Spine readiness
and flagged plan/promotional state and amount-due as absent from it. This PR's
`get_billing_spine_evidence()` is built on the NEWER `get_workspace_billing_status()` instead, and
now supplies both of those fields (policy-bounded — never a full ledger). Which contract Spine's
actual caller wires to is a follow-up integration decision, not resolved by this PR.

**Hotfix (owner report 2026-09-03): the live click did not work for Mogul Maker Academy.** Full
trace and the dead-button UX fix recorded in `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md`'s copy of this row
(kept there, §18 one home, rather than duplicated here). Summary: server-side authority, decision
logic, and the deployed bundle all traced correct — for MMA AND for a freshly `provision_tenant()`
-created test workspace, proving the flow is already unified between new and existing accounts —
and platform-wide, forever, zero Stripe checkouts of any kind (platform-billing OR portal) have
ever completed or been refused. The most likely blocker is a `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` Edge secret never
having been configured — a credential this session cannot read or fabricate, named honestly as the
owner's action rather than guessed around. Independent of that, a real UX defect was fixed: a
durable (retry-cannot-fix) refusal no longer leaves the action button clickable.

### PAIGE Mind — the approved 3D knowledge orb, LIVE on the Solo surface (production port) — 2026-09-06

**What shipped (PR #969).** The owner-approved living **WebGL knowledge orb** replaces the hand-rolled
2D-canvas topology on the Solo (and sub-account) **Command Center → Mind** subtab
(`src/solo/SoloMindWorkspace.tsx`). This is a **presentation + reconciliation** change, not a new data
capability: the orb is wired to the **same live reads the surface already used** — `useSoloKnowledge`
(`tenant_knowledge_docs`), `useCommandCenter` (pending approvals), `useN8nSpineReadiness` — reconciled
onto the six owner-approved domains (`src/solo/mind-orb/mindDomains.ts`). It does **NOT** add
authenticated Rail/Spine Mind evidence — the integration matrix below (axis B: nothing flows via
Rail/Spine) is **unchanged**.

**Honesty (§13/§70).** Knowledge / Connected sources / Operating decisions populate from those live
hooks; **Business context, Client relationships, and Offers render an honest absence** (no frontend
read-hook yet / catalog lives in Campaigns) — never invented data. §58: Systems Check findings are not
surfaced in Mind (they stay in the Systems Check subtab). Nodes carry a record's canonical source
STATE; the orb renders presentation, never fabricated activity.

**Build.** The frozen approved prototype engine was promoted verbatim into `src/solo/mind-orb/engine.ts`
as a `createMindOrb()` factory (no rendering values changed, §28); `MindOrbCanvas.tsx` mounts it
code-split (three ships as a separate ~48 KB lazy chunk), WebGL-gated, degrading to the record list on
failure (§32, never blank); reduced-motion (toggle + OS), offscreen pause, dispose all wired. Subtab
order unchanged (Systems Check → Mind).

**Proof.** 28 unit tests (reconciliation honesty + component) + 47 sibling command-center tests green;
`tsc`/`eslint`/`vite build` green with the engine code-split; a headless SwiftShader smoke proves the
factory renders lit pixels + disposes cleanly. **§32.c authenticated live-drive of the deployed surface
is OWED to the owner** (headless can't auth the app). Evidence:
`docs/evidence/ui-delivery/command-center-mind-production-port.md`; per-tier rows:
`docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md`. Fast-follow: frontend hooks for the three not-yet-wired domains.

### PAIGE Mind — the integration matrix (Wave 0 grounding, 2026-09-03; documentation only, NOTHING shipped)

**What it settles.** `docs/architecture/paige-mind-integration-matrix.md` records, per Solo surface,
whether that surface can safely give PAIGE real tenant-scoped evidence — and what is in the way where
it cannot. Read-only architectural truth; it changes no runtime surface, shared module, Rail, Spine or
Mind implementation.

**The headline, and it is not encouraging.** **No surface has authenticated, tenant-safe Mind evidence
flowing today — including Pipeline.** The matrix carries two deliberately separate axes so that a
`PARTIAL` readiness label can never be mistaken for a working capability: one for what the contract
could carry, one for what a real owner can actually get, which is currently nothing anywhere.

**Why.** Verified on prod: `paige_client_events` grants `authenticated` and `anon` **nothing**, so the
Rail is readable only through a `SECURITY DEFINER` lens, and it holds **9 rows** platform-wide (live
count 2026-09-03T09:35Z). On top of that, four structural constraints — the Rail is per-client, the
resolver accepts only a client subject, the safe summary is a constant with enumerated facts, and
evidence loads only inside a client-scoped Chat turn — leave the registry at **exactly one capability**
and put most departments behind Change Requests that have not been raised.

**§13 — two tracker/record divergences this entry does NOT resolve, because only the owner can.**
(1) **#746 is CLOSED on GitHub** (2026-09-02T18:21:05Z, merged PRs #785 and #801), while §10 of this
document at the *"Owner-ruled priority order"* block states "**#746 is still OPEN**" pending
authenticated owner runtime proof. The functional position is agreed — a safe server resolver is
deployed and no owner-facing consumer uses it — only the issue state differs.
(2) The same ruling lists **item 5 as "Calendar as the next bounded read-only Spine capability"**, while
the Mind Wave 0 direction confirmed Calendar **BLOCKED** and prohibited Calendar work this wave.

**Recommended next Mind step is not a build:** the authenticated two-Solo-tenant drive of the one
capability that already exists. **Its prerequisite is not #746** — the lens is `SECURITY DEFINER` and
reads the Rail directly, so the browser grant never applied to it. The prerequisite is that a
`campaigns_pipeline` Rail row must exist at all: production holds **zero**, so the drive would today
prove only the empty-result path. If a build is wanted behind it, raise **SCR-2** (non-client subject
types) naming Analytics as its reference consumer — recording honestly that Analytics needs **SCR-3 as
well**, since its counts are unbounded and the contract admits only enumerated values. **Clients is
explicitly not recommended** despite being the only other client-subject surface: the owner's own UI
write emits no Rail event, so a capability built today would let PAIGE state a history that omits
everything the owner did by hand.

**Raised, not implemented, and routed away from Mind:** #786 and #787 (Rail producers) · #788
(Connections/security, tracked privately).

### Billing Foundation A — workspace billing identity + designated billing contacts (PR #816, **MERGED `f455d8a5` 2026-09-03 under owner Gate B; migration `20261045000000` APPLIED on prod, edge functions deployed**)

**Live state, verified on prod 2026-09-03 (not inferred from a green pipeline):** `20261045000000` is in
`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`; the 3 tables, 12 functions, 6 policies and the guard triggers exist
when queried directly; `platform_billing_accounts`, `_contacts` and `_notification_log` each hold **0 rows**
(reconcile found 0 candidates, exactly as predicted — the 4 live `platform_subscriptions` rows carry NULL
customer ids); no proof fixture persisted. Edge: `platform-billing-portal` v2 ACTIVE, `customer-portal` v44,
`stripe-webhook` v50, all deployed by `deploy-edge-functions.yml` on the merge commit.
**`PLATFORM_BILLING_PORTAL_ENABLED` was NOT flipped** — the portal refuses every call `not_enabled`.
**Nothing is owner-visible: no screen mounts the hooks, and no surface calls the authority read** — that is
Foundation C, which is not built. **No email was sent; no sender exists.**

**What it is.** The first Platform Billing slice after the Gate 1 packet (#803): one server-authoritative
workspace→Stripe-customer mapping (`platform_billing_accounts`), the strict money-path resolver
`billing_active_tenant_id()`, the one authority read `get_workspace_billing_authority()` (Owner-only
`can_manage_billing` / `can_view_billing`; `billing_account_state` absent / ambiguous / mapped /
not_applicable; `billing_contact_state`; `paid_activation_ready`), the reconcile seam, a default-off hosted
portal function, the legacy `customer-portal` refusal for platform customers, mapping upserts at both
webhook write sites — **plus the owner's 2026-09-02 billing-notification ruling designed in:**
`platform_billing_contacts` (**primary billing contact** = a verified, current, active workspace Owner;
**billing delegate** = a verified, current, active Admin chosen by an Owner — functional designations
that never create, change, transfer, imply or record legal ownership, equity, corporate/trust or
co-owner status (owner correction R27, 2026-09-02); Owner-only designate/revoke RPCs, audited), `platform_billing_paid_activation_ready(tenant)` for the later
activation release (**no caller yet: today's `platform-subscription-checkout` still activates a paid plan without
a designated primary billing contact — wiring the gate is the activation release's scope**), and the
`platform_billing_notification_log` ledger with the explicit event catalogue.
**Delivery is NOT wired; no email is sent by anything in this slice.**

**Evidence classes (kept separate).** Automated: vitest 1913/1913 (25 new), Deno 31/31. Static: tsc ratchet
13/13, eslint, `lint:definer-fns`, `lint:views`, `lint:managed-schema`, `lint:tier-features`, migration lint
(1 answered warning), `deno lint`; `deno check` only via CI's Deno ratchet (local esm.sh 404). Runtime,
rollback-proven on prod on the final migration text: 64/64 properties (C1–C2, P3–P64) + 5/5 mutants caught,
nothing persisted (re-probed). Independent review of the head: two FIX-THEN-SHIP reports, all findings integrated.
**No email was sent; no sender exists.** **UNVERIFIED:** authenticated owner drive of the deployed portal
(flag stays off); local `deno check` on supabase-js-importing functions (esm.sh 404 through the proxy).

**What Gate B for this slice asks for, and nothing more:** merge + migration apply + edge deploy with
`PLATFORM_BILLING_PORTAL_ENABLED` unset. No Stripe object, no price, no charge, no entitlement record, no
recipient email. Prod backfill inserts **zero** rows (0 reconcile candidates; the 4 `platform_subscriptions`
rows carry NULL customer ids). Next: Foundation B (webhook classification + subscription truth, A3/A4),
Foundation C (truthful Solo Billing screen; mounts both hooks), then the Promotional Beta Access rollout
packet with its own Gate B. Design: `docs/delivery/billing-foundation-a-design.md` (v3.1). Spine reads a safe
subset only: `docs/handoff/platform-billing-spine-source-contract.md` (PROPOSED/UNMERGED; refreshed on merge).
### PAIGE Mind — first Pipeline evidence slice (SUPERSEDED 2026-09-02 — merged, deployed and applied; see §4)

> **Corrected in place, not deleted (§58).** This entry was written while the work was an
> unmerged branch. It merged as PR #747 (`dcddf6761e`), production-deployed, and migration
> `20261041000000` is persisted on prod. The live record is §4 → *PAIGE Mind — a recorded
> Pipeline outcome, read and cited*. What remains genuinely unverified is listed there and
> corrected in the final bullet below.

- **Mind binding moves `UNAVAILABLE` → `PARTIAL`** for `pipeline.deal_stage_evidence`. PAIGE can state what a
  recorded Pipeline stage outcome proves for the active tenant and a selected client, cite its safe reference,
  and say plainly when she does not know. Read-only throughout.
- `_shared/paige-spine/mindEvidence.ts` is the Pipeline domain's Mind projection — citation, freshness word,
  read-only boundary — over the merged safe adapter `public.get_pipeline_spine_evidence`. It is deliberately NOT
  a platform-wide Mind primitive; generalising it needs its own Spine Change Request. `chatEvidence.ts` renders
  that projection, so Chat and Mind cannot describe one record differently. `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` was NOT edited.
- **Owner-approved Spine Change Request (2026-09-02):** the opaque `rail:<uuid>` reference may cross into model
  context as the citation. It is the one identifier permitted to, it names a record rather than a person or a
  deal, and it is asserted to appear only inside the citation. Title, summary, payload, stage name, deal id,
  contact/client/user/tenant ids, provider bodies, secrets and reasoning traces all stay forbidden.
- **Two reachability findings, both from current main:** `paige:open` had three dispatchers and NO listener, so
  every "Ask PAIGE" on Pipeline dispatched into nothing; and a Pipeline deal carried `clientName` but no
  identifier, so a deal card had no client scope to hand over. Migration `20261041000000` adds `client_id` to the
  innermost deal projection, read off the already-filtered clients join so it is null exactly where the name is.
- **Pipeline mutation through the Spine stays `UNAVAILABLE`.** No Chat tool, no approval channel, no write path;
  approval authority remains `none`.
- Truth status: 1859/1859 vitest, tsc ratchet unchanged at 13, production build green, 11 CI guards green, and a
  local-Postgres runtime proof that is **mutation-tested** (flipping the identifier's source makes it fail with a
  named LEAK). **UNVERIFIED, and still owed:** authenticated runtime, rendered proof, Supabase pgTAP/full-history
  replay. **CORRECTED 2026-09-02:** the migration **is** applied to prod — the §32.a persisted-apply confirmation
  was taken after merge and is recorded in §4. Detail: `docs/delivery/paige-spine-mind-handoff.md`.

### NEXT REQUIRED LANE — Pipeline Chat Write Bridge (owner direction 2026-09-02; NOT STARTED, NOT IN THE MIND BRANCH)

**Owner decision update, 2026-09-04:** the owner explicitly approved canonical PAIGE approval for approval-required Pipeline moves, with the same stage rules enforced in Chat and on the board instead of a separate Pipeline queue. The historical NOT STARTED heading above describes the earlier state; bounded implementation grounding is now active on `codex/solo-pipeline-spine-connectivity`. See `docs/architecture/paige-spine-foundation.md`, SCR-2026-09-04. Shared Chat adapter review, implementation and authenticated proof are still pending; no capability or production release is claimed.

**Local implementation checkpoint, 2026-09-04 — NOT LIVE:** exact caller-scoped Pipeline reads and move preparation are implemented locally; the additive `execute_pipeline_deal_move_as_paige` executor is in `20260904052832_solo_pipeline_governed_move_executor.sql`. It uses the existing canonical gate's server-only channel, not a new approval mechanism, and rechecks explicit active workspace, tenant/admin authorization, exact pipeline/deal/target identity and versions, target policy, and current `deal_move_stage` autonomy. It preserves status/close-date semantics, records attributed activity/audit/idempotent outcomes, and rolls back a linked-client Rail failure. No old held requests or production records were changed.

Proof checkpoint: 30 focused Node checks pass; 29 isolated PostgreSQL cases pass against the actual migration with **synthetic authorization/autonomy/Rail dependencies** (`scripts/pipeline-move-db-proof.mjs`; evidence `outputs/pipeline-move-db-proof/run-NqU035/`). Migration SHA-256 `8638df7813468171bb9d774675e8479502e873af223dbf7636150994f331d51e`; the disposable database was stopped. This is not full-schema replay, authenticated Chat/browser proof, or a green release. Shared Chat/board wiring remains paused for the owning Chat compatibility response, per coordinator direction. Remaining work includes closing legacy/alternate move callers, supported deal creation/edit paths, workspace Rail and Mind integration, actual role/Rail compatibility, interruption/retry and cross-surface proof. The existing Mind text saying no Pipeline write tools exist must not be mistaken for the intended capability boundary; evidence remains read-only, while separately authorized actions use owning contracts.

**Checkpoint refresh, 2026-09-04 — NOT LIVE:** the command now carries `pipelineId` as required by its executor; malformed selection input refuses without throwing. The linked-client Rail call uses the existing service path only after Pipeline authorization, clears/restores both subject claim representations, and records the requesting actor in its payload. Focused Node checks: 40 PASS. Isolated PostgreSQL checks: 33 PASS, including unchanged prepared-command execution, foreign-client refusal, claim restoration and rollback. Evidence: `outputs/pipeline-move-db-proof/run-5l0P5L/`; migration SHA-256 `adbfc1336bf43228d9b18795584186309deea14a1c48e0ed6c3468cb42818144`. Dependencies remain synthetic; actual shared-helper and authenticated runtime proof remain UNVERIFIED.

Chat-owner review clears the narrow adapter direction but requires preservation of PR #914, stored-command/version/idempotency binding, exact stored-target revalidation, and editable board context without automatic sending. Its inherited canonical proposal-store integrity finding remains a release blocker for trustworthy approval. Resolve with the canonical Chat authority owner, not a Pipeline-specific approval store. The owner authorized completion and deployment conditionally on readiness; no merge, deployment or production data mutation has occurred. Cross-task forwarding of the security finding was blocked by automatic review pending specific sharing permission.

This is one domain slice of the AI COO architecture, not authority to redesign Trust Compass, Systems Check or other departments. The owning command must supply tenant-safe evidence, governed execution and attributable durable outcomes usable by Rail and Mind. Existing pending requests and unrelated domain data must be preserved.

PAIGE Chat is intended to become Pipeline **write-capable**. The read-only Mind evidence slice above is the first
foundation, not the endpoint. The initial write slice focuses on real deal work: create or link a deal to an
existing client, update permitted deal details, and move a deal through existing tenant-owned stages. Every write
must use the canonical Chat risk/approval gate (`_shared/action-risk.ts` + the confirmation gate — never a second
channel, `docs/doctrine/one-approval-gate.md`), server-resolved tenant and client scope, idempotency, a durable
outcome, an owner-visible result, failure/retry handling, and no cross-tenant leakage.

**It requires its own Gate 1, its own collision check, and a coordinated Chat-owner workstream, after the active
PR #729 hotfix is clear.** It was deliberately NOT implemented in the Mind branch, and that branch must not be
expanded into it.


### PLATFORM-LEVEL — PAIGE Spine / Rail current state + the owner's priority order (2026-09-02)

Full record: **`docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md`**. Recorded here because these are
platform-wide facts, not one department's, and because two of them are routinely misread.

**The Spine is `PARTIAL`. One registered capability, 105 inline Chat tools.** Measured by the repo's
own guards on 2026-09-02: `paige-spine-registry-lint` → `PASS (1 capability)`;
`chat-tool-registry-lint` → `105 tool(s) inline`. That one capability is
`pipeline.deal_stage_evidence` — read-only, `chatBinding: PARTIAL`, `mindBinding: PARTIAL`
(raised from `UNAVAILABLE` by PR #747, merged 2026-09-02; still `PARTIAL`, not `LIVE`).
**Do not read the Spine's existence as departments being connected to PAIGE.** They are not; she
reaches them through the 105 hand-wired tools. Team and Setup each record the same of themselves in
their surface cards.

**Owner-visible Solo Rail activity is `UNAVAILABLE`.** Status, verbatim:
*production Rail history cannot be read, and the current owner-facing consumer treatment is not
reliable enough to distinguish denied history from empty history.* **Not healthy, not empty, not
honest, not repaired, not production-executable.** `paige_client_events` has **no SELECT grant for
`authenticated`** on production (revoked by `20260712200000`, never re-granted; read-only catalog
query 2026-09-02), so the read fails before RLS. Per issue **#746** — re-verified here — the two
shipped Context Rail consumers (`PaigeRailFeed.tsx:108`, `ClientActivityFeed.tsx:144`) destructure
only `{ events, connected }`, and `historyError`/`historyLoaded` have no reader in `src/`, so **a
refused read renders as "nothing yet"** and an operator can be told PAIGE has done nothing. (The Solo
Trust Compass consumer, `compass.tsx:377`, does distinguish — which is why the platform statement is
*not reliable enough* rather than *never*.) **Leg 7 of the build path — *owner can see the result* —
is therefore broken for every department that emits to the Rail**, and `paige_audit_log` has no Solo
reader either.

**A safe server-side Rail reader is now SHIPPED and deployed — and the verdict above still stands
(2026-09-02).** `public.get_solo_rail_activity(p_limit integer)` is live on production
(`20261042000000`, then the #794 remediation `20261043000000`; both confirmed in
`schema_migrations`). It is `SECURITY DEFINER`, takes **no tenant parameter**, returns 11 reviewed
display fields, and **raises `42501 RAIL_FORBIDDEN` rather than returning an empty timeline** on
refusal — so a denied caller can no longer be mistaken for an idle workspace. The projection omits
`payload`, `tenant_id`, `contact_id`, `actor_user_id`, `ref_table` and `ref_id`; it **does** return
the event row's own `id`, so the accurate claim is that it exposes **no tenant, client, actor or
source-record identifier and no producer payload** — not that it carries no identifier at all. It deliberately does **not** re-grant browser SELECT on
`paige_client_events`: that revoke is what keeps the same-shaped flaw in the `pce_staff_read` policy
unreachable, so the fix for a Rail screen is never a table grant.

**Every Rail READER is now authority-correct and refuses explicitly (verified on the deployed bodies,
2026-09-03).** Two migrations landed after the paragraph above was written and are recorded here
because they were not — see the §13 note that follows:

| Migration | PR | What it changed |
|---|---|---|
| `20261044000000` | #813 (closes #804) | `get_client_rail` reads the caller's role from an active `tenant_members` row **of the same workspace the rows come from**, so a staff role earned in another tenant no longer satisfies it; adds the minimal `get_client_rail_for_chat` projection |
| `20261049000000` | #834 | `get_platform_rail` raises `42501 RAIL_FORBIDDEN` instead of `RETURN;`, so a denied platform caller is no longer indistinguishable from an empty platform |

Both confirmed present in `schema_migrations` on prod. The resulting state: **no Rail reader carries
the tenant-agnostic `has_any_role()`, and no Rail reader answers a denial with an empty set.** The
Rail **writer** `record_rail_event` still gates on `has_any_role()` — tracked as **#824**, parked; it
is an integrity/attribution exposure inside a single workspace, not a disclosure or cross-tenant one,
and its escalation population measures zero.

**§13 — this entry is a late correction, and the lateness is the point.** §0 and §66 require the
master record to move in the SAME PR as the ship. Neither #813 nor #834 did that, so between
2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03 this file described a Rail reader surface two migrations behind production
while reading as current. Recorded rather than quietly backfilled, because a record that silently
catches up teaches nothing about why it fell behind.

> **CORRECTED 2026-09-03 — Slice B repaired exactly this (§58: the paragraph below is kept as
> written, not deleted, because it was true when written).** All four owner-facing Rail consumers
> now call the deployed resolvers, and each distinguishes loading, refusal, unavailable, empty and
> populated. See the Slice B entry below.

**Still NOT repaired by any of the above, and the reason the verdict at the top of this section
stands: no OWNER-FACING consumer calls any of these resolvers.** `useRailEvents.ts` and
`useSoloActivityFeed.ts` still read `paige_client_events` directly, and the browser still holds no
SELECT on it, so the owner-visible history surfaces are exactly as broken as before.

**Be precise about "nothing uses it", because that is not true of the whole Rail.** `get_client_rail_for_chat`
**does** have a live production consumer: the PAIGE Chat edge function calls it at
`supabase/functions/paige-ai-chat/index.ts:4662` (hydration) and `:8384` (tool dispatch), wired by
#813. So the accurate split is: the **Chat** consumer was repointed onto a safe resolver and works;
the **owner-facing history** consumers were not, and are Slice B — blocked on the #776/#729 ownership
seam. `get_solo_rail_activity` and `get_platform_rail` are the two resolvers with genuinely zero
callers today.

### Rail Solo reachability — the tenant-wide rail becomes visible in Solo (2026-09-03, no migration)

**Shipped.** A compact `Recent activity` panel in the Solo Command Center → Systems Check side
stack, reading the already-deployed `get_solo_rail_activity` through the existing
`useSoloActivityFeed`. Frontend-only: no migration, no grant, no policy edit, **no new Rail source**
(`useSoloActivityFeed.ts` is byte-unchanged), and no CSS — it reuses the surface's own panel classes.

**The gap it closes.** Slice B repaired `PaigeRailFeed`, but that component ships inside
`PaigeWorkspace`, which `TenantCommandCenterShell` renders **only when the Solo workspace is
absent** — and the Solo shell always supplies it. So the tenant-wide rail was structurally dark for
**every Solo tenant**: the safe reader was deployed, the consumer was repaired, and no Solo surface
showed it. A repaired consumer on an unreachable surface is not a repaired capability.

> **§13 CORRECTION, 2026-09-03, same day — the claim above is WRONG and is kept, marked, rather
> than rewritten (§58).** "A Solo tenant had no tenant-wide rail surface at all" is false, and it
> contradicts the table in this same edit. `TrustCompass` IS mounted on Solo (`SoloApp.tsx:253`)
> and its panel calls `useSoloActivityFeed` (`compass.tsx:469`); so does Team → Activity
> (`team.tsx:233`). Both read `get_solo_rail_activity`, which is the TENANT-WIDE reader. So Solo
> already had two tenant-wide rail surfaces before this slice.
>
> **What was actually true, stated precisely:** `PaigeRailFeed` — the specific strip Slice B
> repaired — is unreachable on Solo, and the Command Center, Solo's DEFAULT LANDING route, carried
> no Rail surface. The panel's real value is putting the rail on the surface a Solo owner lands on,
> not making a previously-invisible capability visible.
>
> Caught by an independent review on #877 (P2), after merge. The overstatement had been repeated
> into the master reference, this record, the tier matrix, the PR body, the commit message, and the
> report to the owner — one unchecked claim propagated to six places because it was written once and

**Five answers, kept apart:** real activity · genuinely empty · loading · refused · unavailable. A
refusal never renders as an empty state. Safe fields hold by construction — the resolver's
projection carries no payload, ref_table, ref_id, actor_user_id, tenant_id or contact_id, the row
id is a React key and is never rendered, and the server's error string is never printed.

**Workspace switch:** `CommandHub` already keys the mount on `activeTenantId`, so a switch remounts
the subtree and nothing survives it; the panel also forwards `workspaceId` into the feed's
render-time guard and request counter as a second layer.

**Evidence.** Full suite `197 files / 2770 tests` green; `tsc`, ESLint, `lint:views`,
`lint:definer-fns`, `lint:tier-features` clean; 12 new regression assertions, every mechanism
deliberately falsified. **`UNVERIFIED` — authenticated runtime proof**, tracked on #874.

### Rail Slice B — the owner-facing consumers call the safe readers (2026-09-03, no migration)

**Shipped.** Four owner-facing consumers moved off the direct table read and onto the deployed
resolvers. This is a **frontend-only** change: no migration, no new grant, no policy edit.

| File | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `src/hooks/useRailEvents.ts` | `.from("paige_client_events")` (tenant **and** client scope) | `get_solo_rail_activity(p_limit)` for tenant · `get_client_rail(p_contact_id, p_limit, 'client')` for client |
| `src/solo/data/useSoloActivityFeed.ts` | `.from("paige_client_events")` | `get_solo_rail_activity(p_limit)` |
| `src/components/paige/PaigeRailFeed.tsx` | `{ events, connected }` — error discarded | consumes `historyStatus`: loading · refused · unavailable · empty · populated |
| `src/components/app/ClientActivityFeed.tsx` | `{ events, connected }` — error discarded | same five states, in client-facing language, with no SQLSTATE or server string on the surface |

**The measurement that makes this the whole repair, verified read-only on prod `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`
2026-09-03:** `has_table_privilege('authenticated','public.paige_client_events','SELECT')` = `false`.
Every direct read was **refused in production, for every owner, always** — and the two
`useRailEvents` consumers rendered that refusal as *"Nothing across your clients yet"* and
*"Nothing yet"*. The feeds were not sparse; they were denied and said the opposite. Both resolvers
are `EXECUTE`-granted to `authenticated` and **not** to `anon`.

**§9 tightening, not a widening.** The direct read was governed by `pce_staff_read`, which carries
the §59 global-role trap (`has_any_role` is tenant-agnostic while `current_user_tenant_id()` honours
`active_tenant_id` at any membership role), so a plain member of one workspace holding a global
`coach`/`admin` role could read that workspace's whole tenant Rail. `get_solo_rail_activity` requires
an active `tenant_members` row **of the resolved workspace** at owner/admin/coach. The policy itself
is unchanged and still carries the trap; it is simply unreachable from these four consumers. The two
Analytics readers of the same table remain tracked as **#802**, routed to Analytics.

**Request safety.** Both hooks carry a monotonic request counter, bumped **during render** on a scope
change and again per read, so a slow answer for a workspace already left is discarded rather than
winning by arriving last, and the previous workspace's events are never painted under the new one's
heading — not even for one frame.

**Evidence, by class.** Automated: full suite `180 files / 2351 tests` green, including a new
five-case regression suite (successful history · empty history · denied read · workspace switch ·
stale response) driven through the **real** components, each mechanism deliberately falsified to
prove the tests fail on the defect they name. Static: `tsc` clean, ESLint clean, `lint:views` /
`lint:definer-fns` / `lint:tier-features` green. Production catalog: the grants above, read-only.
**`UNVERIFIED` — authenticated owner runtime proof**: no browser drove the deployed surface as a
signed-in owner in this session, so #746 stays open until that proof exists.

**Ownership.** The #776/#729 consumer-ownership seam was resolved by owner decision on 2026-09-03.
Nothing was adopted from either branch: all four files were read from current `main` and edited in
place. Transfer record in task #29.

**Why `UNAVAILABLE` is still the correct status.** No owner-facing consumer calls the resolver yet —
`useRailEvents.ts` and `useSoloActivityFeed.ts` still read the denied table directly, re-measured on
production after both migrations. The remaining *misreporting* is narrower than the read failure: the
two `useRailEvents` consumers collapse a refusal into an empty feed, while `compass.tsx:377` and
`team.tsx:235` both render an explicit `role="alert"` failure. **All four are denied; only two of them
lie about it.** Failure *visibility* and *manual recovery* are separate questions: `team.tsx` offers a
*Try again* control in every layout, `compass.tsx` only above 1020px — `solo-tokens.css:173` hides its
retry-bearing branch below that and the foldout replacement (`compass.tsx:440`) has none. **Automatic
recovery is present regardless:** `useSoloActivityFeed.ts:193–198` re-reads every 15s while visible and
on window focus, so the missing piece is the *visible manual control*, not recovery. Tracked as a Slice B
scope item on #746, not as a second misreporting surface. The two Analytics readers of the same denied
table (`useClientEngagement.ts:48`, `CohortRetentionTable.tsx:74`) discard the error entirely and render
it as "Insufficient data" — a separate slice, tracked as **#802**. The gap changed shape rather than closing: **before, no safe path
existed; now a safe path exists and nothing uses it.** Issue **#746 stays open**, and closing it also
requires authenticated owner runtime proof, not a deployed function. Full record, including the #794
cross-workspace defect this foundation shipped with and the three lessons from it:
`docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md`.

**Pipeline governance — three findings, follow-up work and NOT capability:** the Spine's Pipeline
evidence is a **silent subset** (`deal_move_stage` and `pipeline_attach` move deals with no Rail
event, so PAIGE cannot see her own move); `deal_move_stage` never consults `move_policy`; and
`pipeline_move_approvals` is **write-only** — nothing anywhere sets `approved|rejected|cancelled`, so
a held request is unresolvable and permanently blocks archiving its stage or pipeline.

**Owner-ruled priority order (2026-09-02).** Later items do not start ahead of earlier ones:

1. **PR #729** — the cross-account Rail/Compass hotfix on #728. **BLOCKED from Gate 2 by issue #746.**
2. **Rail recovery + owner-visible outcome reading — issue #746 (RELEASE-BLOCKING).** This is the required *separate* Rail Recovery prerequisite for #729's first owner flow to become production-executable; it is **not** assigned to #729. PR #644 may hold the right direction but is **NOT authorized as a release path**: it must be freshly grounded on current `main`, checked against the canonical Spine contract, reviewed for internal-identifier exposure, and proven mergeable first — and #746 notes its resolver returns no `title`/`summary`, which the rail renders, so it is not a drop-in.
3. **Pipeline governance repair — issue #755 — a parked prerequisite before any Pipeline Chat write bridge.**
4. **Stale doctrine correction** (done for the Trust Compass claims; see §10).
5. **Calendar as the next bounded read-only Spine capability.**

### Platform Billing — Gate 1 packet delivered and APPROVED 2026-09-02 (Phase 1, read-only; NOTHING BUILT)

- **Boundary (owner-ruled 2026-09-02):** Platform Billing = what the Solo WORKSPACE pays PAIGE (base subscription · included allowances · verified usage/telephony charges only if later approved · paid Marketplace add-ons · invoices, payment methods, status, account credits, entitlement), home Settings → Billing plus operator configuration; the billing account belongs to the workspace, never a staff member. Client Billing = what a Solo charges its own customers (invoices, quotes, payments, balances; Offer Catalog as source; tenant's own processor, §38), home Sales — **never modelled, migrated, or implied inside Settings → Billing.**
- **Delivered (docs only, zero code, zero migrations, zero Stripe objects):** `docs/delivery/platform-billing-gate1-packet.md` (with a §2.7 per-tier availability table, §51/§56) · `docs/doctrine/surface-cards/billing.md` (truth label `PARTIAL`) · `docs/prototypes/platform-billing-gate1.html` (34 states, throwaway) · `docs/handoff/platform-billing-marketplace-addon-handoff.md`.
- **What exists today (verified on `main` `1fb7928`):** Settings → Billing reads plan/status/price/renewal via `get_tenant_platform_subscription()`; Invoices & payment method and Usage & limits are honest `UNAVAILABLE` cards; no action exists on the surface. Plans: `solo` $149/mo, `agency` $397/mo, `enterprise` custom (migration-seeded; monthly Stripe Price only). Sole writer of `platform_subscriptions` is the Stripe webhook. `platform_invoices` has no writer. Metering: `llm_tokens` + `tts_char` in `platform_usage_events`; no allowance/threshold model; no tenant-facing usage read. Marketplace: one-time paid checkout exists; recurring add-ons do not; Solo entitlement actions deliberately `UNAVAILABLE`. Operator Revenue surfaces are spec shells with null figures. **0 paying tenants.**
- **Beta direction ($149 reference → $74.50 beta, defined included allowance, no automatic overage until real usage/cost evidence) is modelled as a PROTOTYPE STATE only.** The eight decisions D1–D8 are ruled or deferred per packet §4.2 (D3, D5–D8 ruled; D1, D2, D4 deferred to the Beta activation packet). As originally put — D1 eligibility · D2 start/end/grandfather · D3 separate Stripe Price vs promotion vs other · D4 after-beta state · D5 exact allowance (units must be a measured meter — tokens today) · D6 warnings/limits · D7 usable/limited/paused after exhaustion · D8 overage automatic/opt-in/unavailable (recommended: unavailable during beta). None invented.
- **Audit findings, all OPEN (packet §3):** A1 HIGH email-keyed `customer-portal`/`check-subscription` (person, not workspace; no admin gate) · A2 HIGH `install_marketplace_item` ungated on `price_cents` (handed to Marketplace owner) · A3 MEDIUM invoice/refund webhook arms not discriminated on `platform_plan_slug` (§197 cross-layer into `tier_state`) · A4 MEDIUM sub-account "no subscription" misreport · A5 LOW/corrected — the `credit_pulls_per_month` seed is already stripped on `main` by `20260726140000`; prod rows UNVERIFIED (an earlier draft mis-reported it as open, caught by the compliance pass) · A6 `platform_invoices` unwritten · A7 no annual Price · A8 telephony `charge_wired:false` (honest).
- **Proposed sequence:** 1 Billing Foundation → 2 Beta Base Plan + truthful screen → 3 Included-usage visibility (no automatic overage) → 4 Marketplace paid add-ons → 5 additional meters one at a time under the eight-field meter contract. Enforcement of any limit lives at the action-bus clamp (§67/§68), via a Spine Change Request, never in the Billing screen.
- **Evidence:** static/code for every audit row; prototype state coverage driven headless by the committed `docs/prototypes/platform-billing-gate1.drive.mjs` (34/34 states, structural-harness class, transcript in the packet §11); authenticated runtime NOT driven; UNVERIFIED — prod meter drain (#737), live `stripe_price_id` resolution, which Stripe account the platform rail uses in prod.
- **GATE 1 APPROVED 2026-09-02 (rulings R1–R17 in packet §4.2–§4.4).** Owner-only billing acts (R2); Stripe-hosted portal (R3); Solo is the canonical billing experience, Operator screens control-plane only (R9); three beta offers — $74.50 paid beta plan (provider release later), 30-day $0 trial, Operator-granted promotional access — behind ONE entitlement projection with a documented precedence rule (R10/R11); **all currently eligible top-level workspaces go onto Promotional Beta Access via explicit records in a dedicated, reversible, separately Gate-B'd rollout after Foundation C — never as a fallback, never counted as revenue (R12–R15)**; paid-subscriber release discipline (R16). Twelve required Solo states (packet §9.1). **Sequence:** #803 docs merge → Foundation A → B → C → promotional rollout packet → its Gate B → trial / paid-beta provider releases. Platform Billing is a standing workstream; every slice carries an exact-head independent review and its own Gate B. **Nothing is merged, deployed, migrated, granted, or created in Stripe by this entry.**

### Multi-membership login account picker (historical Gate 1 record; Platform rule SUPERSEDED 2026-09-07)

- Google OAuth remains the identity authority. On an explicit login Google is asked to show its own identity chooser. **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-13:** after identity is established, Platform staff and every established user with at least one active `tenant_members` row pause at `/choose-account`; even one-workspace users explicitly confirm scope before entering. Genuine membership-less Solo acquisition and signed invite acceptance retain their governed continuations.
- The chooser displays only the caller's RLS-filtered tenant records intersected with their own active membership rows. It never treats an account number, URL, email text or client-supplied tenant id as authorization. **The former Platform-operator direct-routing clause is superseded:** Platform staff explicitly choose Platform or a direct Paige membership. Client/invite continuations and non-platform single-membership users retain their established routing.
- Choosing a workspace persists `profiles.active_tenant_id` through the existing guarded `switchTenant` seam before the browser scope changes. A failed write leaves the current workspace unchanged. The Solo header exposes the same independent-membership switcher; the existing server-gated agency parent/sub-account switcher remains separate and unchanged.
- Truth status: 7 focused policy/OAuth/render tests pass, the TypeScript ratchet adds no errors, focused lint is green and the production build succeeds. Live authenticated Google return, both-account selection, retry, session expiry, account-switch persistence and preview runtime remain UNVERIFIED. Do not merge or deploy without the separate final go-live approval.
### Solo Settings → Team management — ~~local branch, NOT LIVE~~ **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-02: LIVE, capability `PARTIAL`**

> **This entry is kept for its dated detail and is no longer the status.** The work shipped via PR
> #728 (`76bb3bbca`) and is live on production. See §4 → *Solo Team — PAIGE can act on the team* for
> the current record, and `docs/doctrine/surface-cards/team.md` for the department card. Two bullets
> below are now FALSE and are marked where they appear.

- The sparse Team destination is replaced by a roster-first workspace with server-side search/filter, 25-person pages and an explicit Load more path. Settings remains the one vertical scroll owner; the people list never creates a nested scrollbar.
- Enforced tenant permissions remain Owner, Admin, Member, plus truthful read-only presentation of existing specialized permissions. Editable job title and responsibilities describe work only and never participate in authorization.
- Team invitations have review-before-send, pending/resend/revoke/accepted/expired states, email-bound single-use acceptance, and service-role-only token handling. Permission changes have their own owner confirmation.
- ~~Paige chat receives a server-resolved, active-tenant confirmed roster block for the authenticated speaker. Tenant-authored titles/responsibilities are explicitly untrusted reference data; the block cannot send invitations or mutate access and routes confirmation back to Settings → Team.~~ **FALSE as of 2026-09-02.** The roster block and the untrusted-reference-data property still hold, but PAIGE **can** now send invitations and change access — through the canonical approval route, each `high` act behind the real owner approval card. See §4.
- Truth status, CORRECTED 2026-09-02: the structural-harness and static results below still stand, and **migration persistence is now CONFIRMED on prod** (`20261039000000`, `20261040000000` in `schema_migrations`; five `team_*` rows returned by `list_tool_autonomy()`). ~~*Do not merge or deploy without the separate final go-live approval.*~~ — it merged via #728. **Still UNVERIFIED:** authenticated save/reload, real invitation delivery, permission refusal/retry, account-switch and preview runtime. No leg has been driven on the live authenticated platform. ~~25/25 structural-harness checks~~ remain as recorded: 25/25 at 1536×770, 1366×768, 1024×768 and 900×1000; focused tests, type ratchet, security linters and production build green.

### Solo Campaigns -> Pipeline board (Gate 1 approved 2026-08-31; draft PR, NOT LIVE)

**Later bounded deletion hotfix, 2026-09-03:** current implementation and release evidence lives in `docs/delivery/solo-pipeline-empty-delete.md`, not this historical Gate 1 heading. Solo Owners can explicitly confirm the exact UUID-backed PPL reference for an empty pipeline; server transaction refuses deals, routes, automation, approvals and retained history. No Catalog, billing, client/payment, campaign, survivor, shell, or Chat-write redesign. Owner authorized this bounded slice through green release without another routine gate. No production data deletion is allowed for proof. Future agents must read the linked ledger and `docs/doctrine/surface-cards/pipeline.md` before touching deletion.



- **Canonical Solo ownership contract (owner-locked 2026-09-01).** There is exactly one Solo shell
  for every current and future Solo tenant. `src/solo/SoloEntry.tsx` dispatches the authenticated
  Solo route, `src/solo/SoloApp.tsx` composes the domain surfaces, and
  `src/components/tenant-shell/TenantCommandCenterShell.tsx` owns the shared rail, header, page host,
  responsive behavior and one PAIGE workspace. Tenant identity, data, roles, permissions,
  entitlements and capability truth come only from server-resolved tenant context and domain
  contracts. An account number, account name, fixture, demo state or URL value may address a route;
  it must never select a different Solo shell, layout, navigation system, responsive behavior, page
  host or PAIGE workspace. A Solo UI change must prove the affected context and a different known-good
  Solo context at 1536x770, 1366x768, 1024x768 and 900x1000 with PAIGE closed and open. Settings,
  Connections and Integrations may own visible scrolling; Command Center, Clients, Campaigns and
  Analytics remain form-fitting unless the owner explicitly changes that contract.
- Gate 1 locks the board-first Pipeline interaction inside the existing six-tab Campaigns shell. The only post-approval prototype refinement is the smaller page-title word "Pipeline"; lane, card, detail, and supporting-control geometry remain frozen.
- The draft adds multiple tenant-owned pipelines, blank-first creation with only owner-authored custom stages, tenant-owned stage name/description/order/archive/restore controls, contextual deal detail, focused-stage compact behavior, subordinate routing/repair evidence, stable short references and one-level tenant-owned folders with a virtual Unfiled view. No preset pipeline or stage taxonomy is supplied. Campaign linkage is optional; it is not the only reason to create a pipeline.
- The durable contract is tenant-scoped and callable. Read-only members can inspect but not mutate. Occupied stages fail closed on archive. No revenue, ROI, payment, client-health, or unsupported portal facts are inferred.
- Truth status: local contract/render tests, production build and the draft checks are green on the recorded exact head. The deterministic browser proof covers both example Solo contexts at the four locked viewports with PAIGE closed/open; it is local rendered evidence, not authenticated tenant proof. Migration persistence, authenticated save/reload, permission, retry, abandonment, account-switch and production runtime remain UNVERIFIED. Do not merge or deploy without the separate exact-head Gate 2 request.

### Solo Clients → Conversations — implementation awaiting exact-head release verification (2026-08-28)

The owner-approved Solo redesign is intentionally confined to the existing workspace directly below
`People · Conversations · Calendar · Portal`. It adds no route-local Clients hero, title banner, or
parallel inbox. The Conversations-owned implementation provides a unified queue/thread workspace,
a permanently mounted sibling client-context pane, canonical People/Portal/Campaigns/Connections
links, human/PAIGE-draft/governed handling truth, permission-bound composer tools, channel readiness,
account-epoch clearing, pane-owned scrolling, and constrained-center form-fit. Provider connection
does not prove identity, send permission, A2P, inbound, webhook, mailbox, or operational readiness.
Video and Apple Messages for Business remain unavailable unless separately proven. Ordinary consumer
iMessage is never claimed. No backend, provider, schema, auth, or business-data mutation is in scope.

### PARTIAL — Paige self-knowledge is distributed; the governed advisor is unavailable (tasks #159/#219, corrected 2026-09-08)

**Owner:** *"Paige should be aware of her own design."* · *"I just want to make sure that we, as a
collective group, and then eventually Paige gets a lot smarter."*

**Verified state, not assumed.** Paige can be steered AWAY from bad design
(`_shared/cheesy-tells.ts`, the runtime mirror of `docs/design-references/CHEESY-TELLS.md`,
substituted into every generation prompt) and can brief a design agent
(`_shared/design-agent-prompt.ts`). Other bounded self-description primitives now exist across route,
tier, Spine/tool, skill, provider, binding, release, and metering records, so the older claim that she
has **no runtime knowledge of her own system** is superseded. Current truth is `PARTIAL`: those facts
remain distributed, and the tenant-scoped, freshness-aware Self-Knowledge & Migration Advisor defined
in the Runtime Harness section is `UNAVAILABLE`. The design-rationale corpus below is a separate
audience-bound source; tenants must not receive Paige's private platform design rationale.

**The source of truth now exists:** `docs/brain/design-system.md` (2026-08-23) — palette and the two
separately-authored themes, gold-only-on-the-act, type ladder, layered depth, motion reserved for real
activity, layout discipline, taste bar, and an index of every authoritative source. The runtime module
mirrors THIS, exactly as `cheesy-tells.ts` mirrors its `.md`.

**Tier ruling — OWNER-RULED 2026-08-23** ("Yes I agree with CD call on that"). Proposed by Claude
Design, ruled by the owner the same day. Build against this. It needs no new mechanism:

> Design rationale is platform internals. An **operator IS the platform**, so they get the full
> corpus — why champagne inverts between themes, why gold is spent only on the act, why depth comes
> from layered elevation. A **tenant is not the platform**, so the same question is answered about
> **their** system: Settings → Platform already carries "Brand — mark, wordmark, palette, resolved
> recursively" per tenant, inherited by sub-accounts. A client asking "why is this gold?" gets a real
> answer about their own brand set resolved through their inheritance chain — not our internals in a
> friendly voice. **Same function, two corpora, clamped by the grant she already has.**

It fits the existing capability model rather than inventing a tier concept — the corpus selection is
the grant she already holds, doing what it does everywhere else. The risk it closes: never ship one
design block to every persona.

**Sequenced AFTER the Super Admin v3 install rounds (#216)**, per the same owner message: *"keep
finishing building out the design that Claude Design has us doing."* Queued deliberately, not dropped.
Check **#159** (Paige self-knowledge — models, capabilities, cost, from live truth, tier-scoped) before
building: same shape, same tier discipline, probably the same slice — do not create a second home for
self-knowledge (§18).


### Super Admin console import — open slices after #543 (2026-08-18)

- ✅ **DONE (#543) — the console is mounted** behind ONE guard at an `/operator/*` dispatcher, peer to
  `AgencyEntry`/`BusinessEntry`. See Section 4 "§65 R4 slice 1b". All 78 addresses navigable; every
  surface an honest placeholder.
- ✅ **DONE (#544) — the landing targets are FLIPPED.** `OperatorLogin`'s `GOD_CONSOLE` and
  `resolveLandingRoute`'s operator branch both resolve to `/operator/fleet/tenants`. The sequencing
  red-line was honoured in substance: the flip shipped alongside the first REAL surface, not against an
  empty console, so neither door lands on a 404 (the #538 lockout class). §13 correction: an earlier
  revision of this line read "both still `/admin/platform`" — that is now stale.
- ✅ **DONE (#545) — the sign-in bounce.** See Section 4 "§65 R4 slice 1c". It was a stale-context read
  in `RequireOperator`, not a routing target.
- ❌ **The 7 MIXED inner tier gates** (fleet · paige · growth · analytics · provisioning · marketplace ·
  settings/governance) — owner-only tabs inside operator-level sections. Land WITH their surfaces.
- ❌ **§32.c authenticated drive** — STILL THE LOAD-BEARING GAP, and now covers more: the
  unauthenticated half is proven (10/10, see Section 4, including the CD palette in both themes), but the
  rail RENDER, the 78 rendered surfaces, the Fleet topology/internal-chip behaviour, and above all the
  SIGN-IN BOUNCE FIX (#545) all need a session with operator credentials. Re-run
  `scripts/live-drive/operator-console-drive.mjs` plus an authed walk + §25 taste pass.
- ❌ **15 bespoke CD surfaces still fall back to the generic panel** (task #195): `isMkStore` ·
  `isMkReview` · `isCalMonth` · `isIntGrid` · `isCompose` · `isSupThread` · `isWeekGrid` ·
  `isBufferDiagram` · `isPipeHead` · `isSocialGrid` · `isSocialQueue` · `isPipeBoard` · `isStageBoard` ·
  `isArea` · `isBench` — plus the `platform-brain.js` neural field (`KnowledgeSurface` exposes
  `fieldSlot` as its mount point). Honest, but not the design.
- ⚠ **Real backends behind the surfaces** (task #193): the **Compass lane WRITE path is addressed by the
  2026-09-05 Trust Compass RC** (§10) — the Solo Command Center tab now writes real per-tool autonomy
  via `set_tool_autonomy` (owner live-drive OWED, §32.c, so not yet marked LIVE). Still open: the
  Workspace send seam + chat history, and per-panel reads. Panels not yet wired state they are not connected.
- ⚠ **Optional owner cleanup (task #196), NOT a blocker:** four of the agency's sub-accounts look like
  leftovers — two named "[TEST] …" and two with no `comp_reason` ("Sample Account LTD", "Unknown Name-
  1"). All four are COUNTED and VISIBLE by design (they are inside the customer shell). If the owner wants
  any of them gone, that is a data decision made on the console, not a filter guessed at in code.
- ❌ **28 design tabs are genuinely net-new** (no shipped equivalent): fleet history/alert-rules/team-pulse/
  prospects · paige sandbox/research/memory · trust-compass escalations/dependencies · marketplace build/
  publishers · automations build · 6 analytics lenses · support escalations/response-policy · comms
  templates · provisioning history · settings operator/brand-kit/capabilities/vault/act-as-history.
- ❌ **~20 shipped operator surfaces have NO design home** — sending identities, the platform invite minter,
  the entire affiliate program, error tracking, usage analytics, network-KB insights + doc-promotion queue,
  admin notifications, data-source registry, data maintenance, the Vibe Studio session shell, and the **#31
  revenue-integrity audit** (the §57 source-of-truth enforcement surface). **`/admin/platform/*` therefore
  gets REDIRECTED, never retired** (§58).
- ❌ **#192 — latent §53:** both operator doors gate on `super_admin` only, so a `platform_admin` falls
  through `resolveLandingRoute` to `/pricing`. Latent only because prod has 0 platform_admin holders.
- ⚠ **Migration-map caveat (§13):** the 50-of-78 mapping was derived from the pack's `label`+`intent`
  strings, NOT from the 8,288-line shell. A REUSE verdict means "the slot is filled by a real surface", not
  "no build work needed" — read the shell section for a tab before finalising its verdict.


### Roles remediation — open slices after R1/R2a (2026-08-18)

- ❌ **R2b — wrapper-closure sweep (do this before trusting any count).** The R1 corpus keys on the
  literal tokens `has_role|has_any_role|user_roles`. Policies/functions that gate via `is_admin()`,
  `is_staff()`, `studio_role_ok()` or `check_feature_access()` reach `user_roles` one level down and
  **never enter the corpus** — so the true call-site count is **higher than 186 + 118**.
- ❌ **R3a — `match_paige_memory` structural auth bypass (LATENT, no role required).** Passing
  `_target_client_id := auth.uid()` makes the guard's AND-chain false so the RAISE never fires, while
  the data predicate keys on the attacker-supplied `_target_user_id`; `authenticated`-reachable and
  `SECURITY DEFINER`. **Not exposed today — both target tables have 0 rows** — but it arms itself on
  the memory fabric's first write. Deferred deliberately: a correct fix must also scope the data
  predicate's `client_id` branch, and it has a live caller (`paige-ai-chat`) whose two legitimate
  paths must survive.
- ❌ **R3b — remaining c1 (26 of 31 DEFINER functions) and the c2 review queue (98 policies).**
  Subagent-audited as candidates; **not** independently confirmed object-by-object.
- ❌ **R4/R5 — backfill + dual-read, then the `user_roles` Class-A-only CHECK.** Do not skip to R5.
- ❌ **Net-new roles capability (owner-ruled 2026-08-18, NOT started):** custom-roles table, a
  `title` field distinct from role, and the sales catalog (Sales Lead · Closer · Appointment Setter ·
  SDR · Sales Ops). Verified absent on prod: no custom-roles/permissions table exists, `tenant_members`
  has **no `title` column**, and `app_role` carries **none** of those sales values (only `sales_rep`).
  UI deferred to the Super Admin Settings pack (owner's Option C).


### Paige self-verify BROWSER — Task #126 Slice 2 SHIPPED + §32.c GREEN (2026-08-12)

- ✅ **`services/paige-browser` Fly service (`paige-browser`) — LIVE.** A self-hosted warm-browser Playwright service (cloned from the `paige-visual-renderer` recipe, §18) that drives a URL headless and returns an HONEST structured observation `{ok, final_url, http_status, title, text_excerpt, screenshot_b64, …}`. SSRF-guarded (DNS-resolving fail-closed + `page.route` interceptor), shared-secret gated, DB-free. **Evidence:** healthz 200 at `https://paige-browser.fly.dev`; the Playwright pin fix rebuild was a REAL rebuild (image 649 MB → 817 MB, new Fly deployment id), not a cached re-push.
- ✅ **`verify_deployed_surface` skill — LIVE + §32.c GREEN.** The first self-verify skill: Paige drives a DEPLOYED public Paige surface through the Slice-1b interpreter→browser dispatch seam and REASONS an honest Fork-8 verdict on what actually rendered (§13 — never a hoped-for render). **§32.c PROVEN:** the owner drove `https://paigeagent.ai` through the skill and it returned **real live content** — hero, security copy, CTAs. This ends the "owner-owed live-walk" pattern the whole wave existed to kill — Paige can now self-verify her own deployed surfaces. **§32.c INTEGRITY REAFFIRMED (2026-08-12):** the *pricing* Paige first returned was stale; a full Branch-A/B diagnostic + independent §39 peer-gate proved this a **live-site content defect, NOT a live-drive integrity defect** (`paige-browser` genuinely drives real live prod — see §10). The tool's first live use CAUGHT a real stale-content leak, which the owner-ruled fix below then killed at the root.
- ✅ **Skeleton de-duplicated (§18, owner-ruled 2026-08-12).** `index.html`'s static no-JS/SEO skeleton (inside `<div id="root">`) previously duplicated the React landing (hero, features, **pricing**, security). Duplication is the drift class — a prior pricing PR updated the React tiers and left the skeleton stale, so a headless reader/crawler saw retired pricing. Now the skeleton carries ONLY stable SEO copy that does not change with product decisions (hero H1 + one value-prop paragraph + one CTA); ALL product-decision content (pricing, features, security specifics) lives in React ALONE.
- ✅ **`verify_deployed_surface` selector tightened to post-hydration content (Slice 2 primitive fix).** The skill waited on `h1` — which the static skeleton also has — so a headless read could resolve against the pre-render skeleton. It now waits on `[data-app-ready]`, a marker element rendered by the React root (`src/main.tsx`) that exists ONLY post-mount, so the self-verify resolves against the HYDRATED app and skeleton false-positives are structurally impossible. (Follow-up migration `20260913120000` UPDATEs the live skill row; the already-applied seed is not edited in place.)
- ✅ **Skeleton parity guard live in CI (`lint:skeleton`, §18/§24/§64).** An extensible any-duplicated-content guard: a whitelist manifest of what `index.html`'s `#root` may carry (declared SEO strings) + banned drift-prone tokens; CI fails if any undeclared/product content appears inside `#root`. Catches ANY future duplication class (pricing, features, testimonials), not just the one found. Sibling of `lint:views`/`lint:definer-fns`/`lint:tier-features`.
- **Substrate that made it work (all SHIPPED this wave):** Slice 1a host (PR #486) · Slice 1b interpreter tool-dispatch seam through the §16 clamp (PR #488) · browser-wave activation (PR #490) · Slice 2 skill seed (PR #491) · operator-workspace tenant + `actorTenantId` operator-user fallback (PR #492, the §32.c tenant-resolution fix) · Playwright EXACT-pin `1.62.1` = base image across both Fly services + root (PRs #494 + the 1.56.1→1.62.1 reconciliation, §32.c finding #2) · index.html skeleton de-dup + post-hydration `[data-app-ready]` selector + `lint:skeleton` guard (PR #496, §32.c stale-pricing finding). **Slice 3 (public-web browsing) is GREENLIT — scoping-first (4 owner decisions pending), real new risk classes (SSRF/injection/leakage/cost/cross-tenant).**
- ✅ **Fly-services auto-deploy CI — `deploy-fly-services.yml` (§64 cloud-first, §24 pattern).** The two self-hosted Fly services (`paige-browser` + `paige-visual-renderer`) now deploy on merge to `main` via GitHub Actions (path-scoped, per-service detection matrix — a change to one never redeploys the other; loud fail-fast if `FLY_API_TOKEN` is unset), mirroring `deploy-edge-functions.yml`. Ends the manual `flyctl deploy` laptop dependency (the anchoring §64 case). **Owner prerequisite (one-time):** `flyctl auth token` → add repo secret `FLY_API_TOKEN`. **PROVEN LIVE (2026-08-13):** `FLY_API_TOKEN` set; `workflow_dispatch` (service selector, PR #500 fixed a `flyctl deploy` positional-dir+`--config` path-doubling bug) deployed `paige-browser` → image `deployment-01KZWJF30AQRPJNJX136XVH32A` v5, healthz 200. Ships with new doctrine **§64 (cloud-first, laptop-independent by default)** in CLAUDE.md. **§32.a evidence captured; the manual `flyctl deploy` dependency is dead.**

### Task #126 Slice 3a — public-web browsing SSRF-hardened primitive SHIPPED + §32.c LIVE-DRIVE GREEN (2026-08-13)

- ✅ **`paige-browser` SSRF-hardened + Phase-1 denylist + wildcard flag + `paige_browser_usage` audit rail — LIVE (PRs #499 merged, deployed 2026-08-13; D1=(c) wildcard+denylist owner-ruled 2026-08-12).** The browser primitive now serves **arbitrary public URLs** via a new `POST /browse-public-url` (distinct from `/self-verify`, §18) behind the full guard. The SSRF guard was **extracted to a shared `ssrf-guard.mjs`** (§18 one home; the smoke tests the REAL code, §32) and hardened: granular reason codes, reserved/broadcast/multicast ranges, the 6to4/NAT64/hex-IPv4-mapped embedded-v4 tunnels (the base guard already covered private/loopback/metadata/IPv6-ULA/`::ffff:`/scheme — a §10-logged correction to the "localhost-only" premise). Two-layer content denylist: Cloudflare-for-Families container resolver (`0.0.0.0` sinkhole → guard denies) + a baked StevenBlack/hosts snapshot. **`paige_browser_usage`** is an append-only audit rail — enforced at the **grant level** (not a trigger — the §39 peer-gate caught that a hard immutability trigger would fire on FK CASCADE and make a browsed tenant un-offboardable, §38; fixed to REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE which cascades bypass), RLS tenant-scoped + `is_platform_operator` (§9/§53). §32.b persisted-apply confirmed (migration `20260913140000` live: cols=12, 2 policies, 0 triggers).
- ✅ **§39 LIVE peer-gate GREEN (2026-08-13, owner-driven from Fly, CC ran the deny-matrix from sandbox against the DEPLOYED host).** All 7 tests passed with exact reason codes: `169.254.169.254` → `ssrf:link-local:metadata` **BLOCKED on BOTH `/self-verify` AND the live `/browse-public-url`** (the cloud-metadata credential-leak gate — THE test); `10.0.0.1` → `ssrf:private-ipv4`; `127.0.0.1` → `ssrf:loopback`; `file://` → denied; `https://example.com` → **real content returned** (the §58 positive control proving the Cloudflare-Families container DNS did NOT break resolution); `/browse-public-url example.com` → structured extraction (title/h1/body/links). **Wildcard flag `PAIGE_BROWSER_WILDCARD_ENABLED=true` flipped by owner + validated by the green gate.** Headless pre-proof: 60 SSRF-guard cases (exact reason codes) + §32.b rollback proof.
- **§13 honest notes:** (1) full DNS-rebinding closure is tracked #138 (mid-redirect to a literal internal host IS caught); (2) the StevenBlack denylist is a build-time snapshot — scheduled weekly refresh is task #151. **Next: Slice 3b** (the `browse_public_url` skill that wires Paige's interpreter to `/browse-public-url` + writes the tenant-scoped `paige_browser_usage` row) and **3c** (per-tenant rate limits) are now UNBLOCKED.

### Task #126 Slice 3b — `browse_public_url` skill (public-web research capability) SHIPPED — merged #502, §32.a persisted-apply CONFIRMED (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **The `browse_public_url` platform-baseline skill turns the Slice-3a `/browse-public-url` endpoint into a real Paige capability + FIRST writer of the `paige_browser_usage` audit rail.** A tenant points Paige at a public URL (runtime `inputs.url`, §18 url-from-input — NO static step url); the skill-interpreter routes a `tool:"browser"` step with **`mode:"public"`** to the new public-web browse seam (distinct from `/self-verify`, §18), extracts the structured research shape (title/meta/h1/body≤500KB/links), and forge-summarizes only what actually loaded (§13). Seed migration `20260914000000` — category `operations_process`, `read_only`+`auto` (so the §16 clamp FIRES the browse), `scoping='platform'`, tier §61 default (god yes · solo yes · sub yes · agency resell · enterprise yes+resell).
- ✅ **The audit/metered row is written by the CALLER (skill-interpreter via service_role), NOT the DB-free Fly host (§9/§34).** On every call — allowed OR blocked — exactly ONE `paige_browser_usage` row is written with `tenant_id` = the server-resolved `ctx.tenantId` (EXPLICIT, never body-trusted, §9/§51) and `created_by` = `invoker_user_id`; `blocked_reason`/`http_status`/`content_bytes`/`response_time_ms`/`url_resolved` mapped from the host's structured body. An audit-write miss is logged loud + proceeds (never fabricated, never silently blocks the observation, §13/§32). Host seam `browsePublicViaHost`: **30s hard AbortController timeout + single retry on 5xx/throw** (D4), honest `{ok:false,error}` on double-failure, `{needs_config:true}` when the env is unset.
- ✅ **`verify_deployed_surface` (Slice 2) byte-unchanged (§58):** `pickBrowserStep` now EXCLUDES `mode:"public"` steps so the self-verify path is untouched; `browse_public_url` is the first (and only) `mode:"public"` skill. **Trust Compass:** additive `paige_action_kinds` row `tech.browse_public` → Technology/Automation dept, `auto` lane (`20260914010000`, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, not on the execution path — §16 org-model surfacing only).
- ✅ **Producer (§18/§37):** the ONE audited producer is the existing generic `run_skill` (paige-mcp → skill-runner → interpreter), which already forwards the server-resolved tenant + `invoker_user_id` — so `browse_public_url` is reachable + audits correctly the moment it seeds, with **zero per-surface code**. **Forking a direct `/browse-public-url` call into any surface (paige-ai-chat/subagent-market-research/content-drafter) is PROHIBITED** — it would bypass the `paige_browser_usage` audit write (§9) and fork the host seam (§18). Exposing skills in the primary `paige-ai-chat` inline tool loop is a broader capability (lights up ALL seeded skills, not just browse) deliberately DEFERRED to its own slice with its own §32 verification — same reachability posture as every other seeded skill today (all reachable via `run_skill`, none yet in the main chat tool loop).
- **Verification:** 35 unit tests GREEN (pure core: `pickPublicBrowseStep`/`isHttpUrl`/`foldPublicBrowse` + the §58 `mode:"public"` exclusion); tsc 0; `lint:views`/`lint:definer-fns`/`lint:tier-features` all clean. **§32.a rollback proofs GREEN on prod** (rolled back): skill `SLICE3B_PROOF new=1 cat=operations_process browser=t mode=t lane=auto risk=read_only scope=platform nourl=t fin=0 jarg=0`; Trust Compass `dept=technology_automation lane=auto requires_approval=f`; **§32.b audit-write shape** `inserted_id_ok=t rows=2` (both allowed + blocked row shapes). **§39 peer-gate = SHIP** (independent adversarial read of the real diff — no BLOCKER, no HIGH): §9 tenant-write clean (server-resolved `tenant_id` after the `!tenantId` guard), audit columns exact, §58 confirmed (zero existing `mode:"public"` seeds), retry/timeout correct, migrations pass every CHECK. **Two peer-gate findings fixed in the same PR:** M1 (MEDIUM audit fidelity) — a host transport failure (timeout/5xx/nav-failed) now records a `host:*` sentinel in `blocked_reason` instead of `null` (which the rail reads as "allowed"), so the §17 meter + safety surface count it as a failed attempt; L1 (LOW) — a transient `429` busy is now retried like a 5xx. **§32.a persisted-apply CONFIRMED on prod (2026-08-16, post-merge #502):** `schema_migrations` advanced to include `20260914000000` + `20260914010000`; `browse_public_url` skill row live (`operations_process/read_only/auto/platform`); `tech.browse_public` action_kind live (`technology_automation/auto`); **`deploy-edge-functions.yml` @ merge commit `74d601c2` = completed success** (the public-browse interpreter + `browsePublicViaHost` host code is live). **Still OWED: §32.c live-drive** (`run_skill browse_public_url` from a real tenant → confirm the `paige_browser_usage` row) — needs a paige-mcp/browser-capable session (Cowork/owner); this headless CC session has no paige-mcp connection (honest §13/§32.c).

### Route + URL Taxonomy (§65) — foundation authored, migration NOT yet code (2026-08-17)

- 📋 **`docs/doctrine/route-and-url-taxonomy.md` is the source-of-truth for TARGET routing** — the LOCKED
  6-row matrix (Operator `/operator` · Agency `/agency/{account}` · Enterprise `/enterprise/{account}` ·
  Solo `/solo/{account}` · Sub-account `/business/{account}` · Client `/portal/:tenantSlug`) + the staged
  redirect-safe migration plan. **HONEST state (§13):** this is a DOCS foundation, NOT shipped code — the
  live routes are STILL the current `/admin`-overloaded topology (see `docs/brain/codebase-map.md`). The
  code-rename slices are owner-review-gated (owner reviews the taxonomy + migration order first). Until
  they ship, do NOT assume any target route exists.

### Recently SHIPPED (2026-08-09)

- ✅ **PR #412 — Tenant revenue classification + ARR reconciliation** (task #29) — MERGED. Topology fix + hard-delete-cascade of Paige Operations + Claude Studio Dev + Platform Defaults relocation + Part-5 dropdown + reconciliation + MCP splits. §39 peer-gate 4 findings all resolved. **§32.a persisted-apply PROVEN on prod** (all 4 migrations in `schema_migrations`; 2 retired tenants deleted → 11→9 tenants; 4 PME sub-accounts; 0 paid-class → Fleet Console reconciled to $0).
- ✅ **PR #413 — Master project reference + CLAUDE.md §0** — MERGED (this doc + the session-start rule + Cowork research discipline + verified Comms facts).
- ✅ **PR #410 — Second Brain** (task #26) — MERGED. `docs/brain/` is now live; §BRAIN reloads every session. (Owed follow-up: the §BRAIN.3 "Tenant Classification" config-registry section.)

### In-flight

- 🔥 **PR #415 — Revenue integrity chain** (task #31, Wave 8 launch gate). Fail-closed trigger (`enforce_revenue_integrity_chain`) + operator audit RPC (`operator_revenue_integrity_audit`) + Fleet Console audit UI. §30-diagnosed (handoff schema wrong on every gate → real tables), §37 producer inventory clean, §39 peer-gate + §5 compliance BOTH passed (2 §39 defects + 1 §5 blocker fixed), §32.b proven against the verbatim file. **Draft PR, owner §32.c-gated.** See Section 10.
- 🔥 **Second Brain now LIVE on main** (`docs/brain/`, PR #410 merged 2026-08-09). §BRAIN.1/.2/.3 discipline binds: read `docs/brain/README.md` at session start; answer "do we have X?" from the brain; update the relevant brain file in the same commit as a change.
- 🔥 **Wave 2.5 tail** per canonical-build-order.
- 🔥 **Task #31 — investor-grade revenue integrity chain** (the write-side of #412's read-side; three-gate signup enforcement + audit-trail export). Queued; fires with a §1 crew on owner go.

*(PR #412 revenue classification + $0-ARR and PR #413 master doc + §0 both merged 2026-08-09 — moved to Section 4 SHIPPED.)*

### MVP-blocking gaps (all-open)

- ❌ **Fleet Comms operator SMS `paige-operator-sms-send` returns 500 (CC-root-caused 2026-08-09, fix specified, awaiting owner go).** Owner's §32.c live-drive send to a test recipient failed "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code." CC diagnosis by elimination + code trace: it's HTTP **500 = `authz_check_failed`** (`index.ts:45`) — `caller.rpc("is_platform_owner")` errored. NOT needs_config (returns 200; **MG SID IS set — owner does not need to re-paste**), NOT the upsert (verified OK via rolled-back service-role txn), NOT a Twilio rejection (`twilioRequest` never throws → returns 200 'failed'). Leading cause: `is_platform_owner`/`is_super_admin` each have TWO overloads (`()` + `(_user_id uuid)`), and a PostgREST `.rpc()` against overloaded functions hits **PGRST203** — the #408 fn is the first DIRECT rpc caller (others use it inside RLS/definer). Fix (2 parts): (1) call the owner-check overload-safely + log `ownerErr.message`; (2) add an outer try/catch returning a structured 500 (§32 loud-failure). Same class as §51 #130.
- ⚠️ **Twilio phone-number search — SHIPPED 2026-09-01; only VANITY and PREMIUM/REGISTRY search remain (Task #27).** This row read *"❌ … the ONE narrow remaining Twilio piece"* after search had already shipped, so Sections 4 and 5 asserted opposite states. Search by area code, region, city, digit prefix and toll-free is live in Connections → Communications, as is purchase. Missing: letter-based **vanity** matching and **premium/registry** search. `sms_enabled` sits in the same edge-only category as vanity — the function accepts it, no product caller sends it. Task #27 is rescoped to vanity + premium/registry.
- ❌ **A2P 10DLC carrier submit** — UI exists, backend stubbed; no `messaging_service_sid` table.
- ❌ **SMS-in-signup** — phone capture not in signup migrations (task #23).
- ❌ **`delete_tenant` RPC + MCP tool** — task #30 scope (§10 Paige-callable).
- ❌ **Stripe Connect direct-charge posture verify + BYO tenant processor lane** — Money Spine B-Connect deferred but needed for full §38 posture.
- ✅ **`signup_intake` table EXISTS** (was a false gap — CC live-prod check, task #31 §30 diagnose; §10 correction reverses Cowork miss #3). Per-user pre-provisioning intake (`user_id, account_type, agreement_slug, agreement_version, terms_accepted_at, plan_slug, billing_period, consumed_at`); tenant-level agreement acceptance lands in `legal_acceptances` + `profiles.terms_accepted_at` via `provision_tenant`. Not a gap.

### Reclassified post-MVP → MVP-BLOCKING (owner ruling 2026-08-10)

Five items the owner moved from post-MVP into MVP scope:

- ❌ **#43 — Agency/Enterprise language split.** Per-tier surface labels: Solo/Sub = "People" · Agency = (label TBD) · Enterprise = "Portfolio" · Super Admin = "Fleet". (Companion to #51/#52 below.)
- ❌ **#44 — Super Admin calendar.** REUSE the solo/sub calendar per §18 (one home), extended to operator scope (§35 dogfooding) — do not fork a second calendar surface.
- ❌ **#45 — Paige suggestive personality upgrade.** Extends Sonnet-tier reasoning (§36 intuitiveness moat).
- ❌ **#46 — GitHub-repo skill ingestion connector.** Folded into #35 Standard-Practice Skill Library (Wave 4, L8-adjacent).
- ❌ **#51 — Fleet surface renaming.** Super Admin "Fleet" as a first-class label (Solo/Sub keep "People", Enterprise "Portfolio"). Sibling of #43.

### Owner tasks filed 2026-08-10/11 (external tracker #47–#61)

Recorded here for durability; §30 verdicts noted where CC's diagnostic already resolved the premise.

- ✅/§30 **#47 — Client detail reachability (D4).** ALREADY-CLOSED by #444 (route + `ContactDetail` + nav wired). Not a gap; verify only.
- ❌ **#48 — Send flow channel picker + auto-recipient + threading (D5).**
- ❌ **#49 — Comms threading: sent messages land in the client's Conversations (D5).** §30 fix target: `send-sms`/`send-transactional-email` key on `user_id`, not `contact_id` — that's why sent msgs don't thread into the contact's conversation.
- ❌ **#50 — Format picker (Word / GDoc / PDF / Markdown); PDF must NOT be the default for editable deliverables (D5).**
- ❌ **#52 — Contact management platform-wide consistency** (People / Fleet / Portfolio uniformity across tiers).
- ✅/§30 **#53 — Paige `contact_lookup`/`pipeline_lookup` default TENANT scope.** ALREADY tenant-scoped (`actorTenantId` in `paige-mcp`). Not a gap; verify only.
- ✅/§30 **#54 — Pipeline tab scope-mine.** ALREADY-CLOSED (KPI + board share `filteredDeals`). Not a gap; verify only.
- ❌ **#56 — Conversations default → three-column ready shell (D9).** §30: `FirstRunOnboarding` swaps the whole frame; fix lives in `ConversationsThreeColumnShell`.
- ❌ **#58 — Cross-surface parity audit** (enforces §57 — walk each tenant-facing figure back to its God-level source).
- ❌ **#59 — Fleet Console Attention Queue stale MRR** (`$397` + `$149`) despite 0 paying tenants — needs a `test_seed` filter + `revenue_class='paid'` gate. Ships WITH #31 (revenue integrity chain). (§57 anchor case a.)
- ❌ **#60 — Antonio Daniel LLC misclassified `SUB_ACCOUNT`** in the attention queue — tier reclassification audit (§51/§57 anchor case b).
- ❌ **#61 — Super Admin Analytics gap** (empty vs. a sub-account's live Analytics) — §35 violation; at-least-parity required before shipping more sub-account analytics (§57 anchor case c).

### Tenant Client Portal — MVP commitment; dedicated build not started

The owner-complete Tenant Client Portal vertical is launch-blocking MVP scope and is currently
`PARTIAL`. It must reuse the one Harness and the existing canonical client relationship, invite,
Spine, Rail, Brain/Mind/Memory, provider-state, and release contracts. The larger historical CX
programme is now split: the secure branded owner/client vertical is MVP; composable Marketplace
blocks, revenue-share, broad transformation catalogs, and third-party developer expansion remain
later opportunities unless separately promoted. No implementation starts until the owner explicitly
starts the dedicated Client Portal MVP build.

### Critical DOC gaps (files referenced but ABSENT from `docs/`)

- ✅/⚠ **BRD (Business Requirements Document)** — a BRD-MVP scope doc **DOES now exist** at `docs/product/BRD-MVP-2026-08-08.md` (97 KB, LOCKED 2026-08-08, first-class cited in §9 — doc-alignment Task #32). The earlier "NOT present, largest doc gap" claim is stale — the MVP-scope BRD is present. ⚠ **Open question (owner):** confirm whether this BRD-MVP is the same artifact as the "full BRD" some docs cite as PR #394, or a distinct MVP-scoped subset. Until confirmed, treat `BRD-MVP-2026-08-08.md` as the canonical requirements source of truth.
- ⚠ **System Architecture doc** — same PR #394 reference; NOT present.
- ⚠ **`docs/assessments/PLATFORM_ASSESSMENT_2026-07-13.md`** — cited as ~85% valid; NOT present.

## 7. Sequential roadmap (current state → MVP live)

Per `docs/doctrine/canonical-build-order.md` (LIVING, updated 2026-08-08):

- **Wave 1** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Wave 2** ✅ COMPLETE (except #247 tail)
- **Wave 2.5** 🔥 FIRING — Playwright dev-dep, live-drive backfills, per-sub-account curation, §3.b doctrine paste, #247
- **Wave 4 = MVP HUB** 🎯 NEXT — 4 Owner Trilogy pillars + 5 Cowork-locked product specs + BRD-promoted items (L8 Memory Fabric, Interactive Analytics UI, Playwright web-browsing, Promo Account Type, Chat compaction/history/tasking)
- **Tenant Client Portal MVP vertical** — explicit grant, branded client authentication, approved shared projection, bounded two-way Paige interaction, governed actions, owner revoke/narrow, and fail-closed switching/expiry/relationship/provider states. Current status `PARTIAL`; dedicated build requires a separate owner start.
- **Wave 3** ⏸️ DEFERRED past W6 (Practice Blueprints)
- **Wave 5** 📋 RESERVED
- **Wave 6-7** 📋 QUEUED
- **Wave 8 = BETA LAUNCH prep** — #135 Codex sweep · #74 logo scrub · #194+#195 Stripe wire-up · #129 tenant lifecycle wind-down
- **Wave 9 = SOC 2** (post-BETA)

### Immediate 72-hour queue

1. **#412 merge** (owner §32.c live-drive)
2. **#410 merge** (owner §BRAIN approval)
3. **Task #22 live-drive** (operator SMS with Twilio secret paste)
4. **#411 confirm-merged** (Wave 4a analytics primitive)
5. **Wave 4 kickoff** — MVP hub. Owner rules which pillar/BRD-item fires first.

### Money Spine sequence (per §38 amendment)

B-i ✅ → B-iv ✅ (posture verify pending) → B-ii (in flight) → B-Platform → B-Meter → B-v → B-iii → B-vi. **B-Connect deferred.**

## 8. Daily reference protocol (Cowork + CC + Codex)

### Session start (every session, all three agents)

1. Read this doc — Sections 0, 4, 5, 7
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` (root)
3. Read `docs/brain/README.md` once PR #410 merges
4. If task-specific: load the canonical deep doc from Section 9

### During work

- Before ANY claim about the codebase (what exists, what's wired, what's shipped): grep first, check Section 4 second, memory NEVER
- Before ANY paste that references a table/function/file: verify it exists
- **A finding discovered outside the current assignment's scope becomes a GitHub issue immediately, and is not started.** GitHub Issues are the authoritative individual work records; the PAIGE Attention Register is the one owner-facing view over them. This doc holds material platform truth — its legacy in-file ledger (Section 6) is not extended, and a new finding goes to Issues, never here. The standard — the five records, the register's nine fields and eight views, its eleven delivery statuses, the live lists that already exist, and the honest record that the register's board does not exist yet — is `docs/doctrine/paige-attention-register.md`.
- **CC's code check is authoritative** — Cowork's sandbox agents can miss recently-shipped migrations or files; when CC disagrees with Section 4 or Section 10, CC's finding wins

### Session end (any agent that shipped work)

1. Update Section 4 checkboxes
2. Update Section 5 status
3. Log §13 corrections in Section 10 if surfaced
4. Cross-post to brain (once #410 merges)
5. Commit: `docs(master): update after <PR#/slice>`

## 10. §13 corrections log

 - **2026-09-13 — P0: Paige's consequential-action confirm gate looped instead of executing, and a
   "bug report" could be claimed filed when it was not. FIX BUILT on a fresh-main emergency branch;
   NOT merged, NOT shipped.** Owner-reported: an owner-confirmed `action_advance` dismissal re-issued a
   fresh confirmation each turn then "failed flat"; a bug-report proposal failed to create; nothing
   dismissed/filed/sent. **Correction to the first framing (§13):** the loop MECHANISM is established by
   reading the DEPLOYED SOURCE — NOT a runtime trace of the incident. It is NOT the `#711`
   `paige_tool_confirmations` token path (unwired in `paige-ai-chat`); the live gate is
   `paige_pending_confirmations` + `confirmFingerprint` + a request nonce, and a BATCH of same-tool
   proposals is disambiguated ONLY by the exact fingerprint, which a drifted hashed arg on the approval
   turn defeats → both fallbacks refuse on ≥2 → the drifted fp records a NEW proposal → a silent re-ask
   loop (#1166 closed only `decision_rationale` drift). The actual failing confirmation/action rows and
   the server error category need prod access this session lacks and remain **PROOF OWED.** Fix (on
   branch `claude/p0-confirm-loop-repair`, separate emergency PR — deliberately OFF PR #1177, which
   stays the task↔thread slice only): **A** disambiguate a batch by the stable model-reproduced subject
   id within the operator's approved set; **B** an un-pinnable approval → one honest `execution_unavailable`
   terminal (nothing changed/sent) instead of a loop; **C** `improvement_propose` returns an explicit
   "nothing was filed" for a tenant-less/role-refused caller. §39 cleared all seven gate invariants + two
   guards; §5 NO BLOCKER. **STATUS (honest):** containment is LOCALLY PROVEN (fail-closed logic + tests);
   whether the batch REPAIR actually fires (the `args->>action_id` match on the deployed chat; failure-safe
   → the terminal) and the full owner battery (benign dismissal, batch resolve, expired/replayed/forged/
   cross-tenant, receipt/Rail, no-outbound) are PROOF OWED on the deployed surface. This is a correctness
   fix to an existing gate — **§4 shipped-capability claims unchanged; no Shipped Log entry until the real
   merge SHA + deployment identity + persisted proof exist; §66 tier-matrix unchanged.** Detail:
   `docs/brain/decision-log.md` (2026-09-13) + the lesson in `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md`.

 - **2026-09-12 — The "Solo Calendar is a fixture with no write scope" premise was OUTDATED; the
   mounted Solo Calendar was already a real, tenant-safe, governed surface.** A build brief described
   the Solo Calendar as a fixture (citing `src/solo/calendar-data.tsx`/`calendar.tsx`, whose own
   comments say booking pages/availability/slot-solver/write-scope are "not built"). CC's live-code
   check (§0/§BRAIN.2 — answer from the code, not the claim) found the opposite: those files are
   **dead, orphaned, and a contract test (`TenantCanonicalCalendarWorkspace.contract.test.ts`)
   ENFORCES the Solo shell must not import them.** `SoloApp.tsx:266` mounts
   `TenantCanonicalCalendarWorkspace → SoloCalendarWorkspace` on the real `useSoloCalendar` hook, wired
   to the July-2026 native booking engine that is **deployed on prod** (behind `db-live`/`edge-live`):
   `calendars` + `internal_bookings` + `list_team_bookings`/`create_internal_booking`/
   `admin_set_booking_status` + realtime + a DST-safe slot solver in `public-booking` + the public
   `/book/:slug` page + `emit_booking_rail` → Layer-C `paige_client_events`. So most of the brief's
   "complete intended capability" was **already delivered**; the genuine remaining gap was owner-side
   **reschedule + edit** (the `reschedule_internal_booking` RPC existed but had no owner-side caller;
   no edit RPC existed). Reversal recorded per §11 ("mark reversed, don't delete"): the brief's
   fixture premise is REVERSED; the delivered work (Section 4.0, 2026-09-12) closed the real gap
   WITHOUT rebuilding the calendar (§18/§30). A separate legacy dead subsystem also exists and is NOT
   the live one: `paige_bookings` + `cal-list-bookings`/`cal-cancel-booking`/`handle-cal-webhook` +
   the unrouted `BookingsAdmin`/`CalIntegrationConfig` (Cal.com integration, orphaned). Lesson: a
   "the current thing is a fixture" premise is a claim to verify against the mounted surface first
   (§70 — "already delivered" demands MORE proof), not a license to rebuild.

 - **2026-09-05 — The Solo Trust Compass became a real, tenant-governed control surface — and it is
   recorded as an RC, not a shipped claim, because the authenticated live-drive is OWED.** #780's
   parked state (the dial's numbers were fixtures and its buttons only closed a modal) is closed in
   CODE: Trust Compass is now the third Command Center sub-tab (Business Game Plan → Systems Check →
   Trust Compass → Mind),
   and its per-capability knobs write REAL per-tool autonomy through `set_tool_autonomy` — the one
   tenant-writable governance seam, JWT-scoped to a tenant admin (§59) — read back through
   `list_tool_autonomy` / `resolve_tool_autonomy`. Effective = `min(stored, ceiling, risk cap)`:
   owner-only tools render read-only, `high` tools cap at "Asks first" (the runtime neutralises `auto`,
   §70.1), and the platform ceiling shows only as an effect, never itself (§4.2). The risk-class copy
   in the browser is drift-guarded against `_shared/action-risk.ts` by a test (§18). The mouse-only
   canvas dial and the two false-affordance modals are gone; pending decisions route to the ONE Paige
   chat (§18); legacy `/solo/{account}/trust-compass` redirects into the Command Center path (§58).
   **Verified GREEN, headless:** unit + jsdom-render tests, the tsc ratchet, `lint:{tier-features,
   tool-catalogue,action-risk,…}`, and a green production build. **Still OWED (§32.c):** a real
   Solo-admin session turning a knob and confirming the `tenant_tool_autonomy` write persists — this
   build session has no browser. So this is an RC pending merge + the owner's live review; the §4/#780
   line below stays true until it merges, and the tier-matrix Surface ledger carries the per-tier
   Trust Compass entry.
- **2026-09-05 · Vault filename/attestation scanning is not document inspection:** filename patterns, owner attestation, and magic-byte/hash checks cannot prove that a PDF or image is free of credentials or banking-sensitive content. The Phase 2 repair therefore fails closed: private quarantine and safe audit state may exist, but binary intake/release stays unavailable because no approved OCR/DLP adapter is configured and every promotion entry point is revoked. Do not describe the upload UI, synthetic scanner outcomes, or quarantine rows as live document inspection.
 - **2026-09-05 — five chat artifact-creation tools reported success on a 200-with-empty-payload
   (SHIPPED §13/§70 dishonesty, fixed in PR #972).** `generate_image`, `draft_marketing_content`,
   `content_save`, `document_generate` and `growth_page_save` emitted `{ success: true, … }` even
   when the underlying edge fn / RPC returned HTTP 200 carrying no real artifact — a null public URL,
   an empty drafts array, or a null saved id — because a 200-with-empty-payload does not throw. That
   one dishonest field then drove three consumers at once: the model narrated a fake success, the
   `describeStep` status label showed "done"/"image ready", and the artifact card pushed with no
   artifact. Corrected: a new pure home `supabase/functions/_shared/artifact-receipt.ts`
   (`artifactProduced(shape, value)` + non-leaky `ARTIFACT_ABSENT_ERROR`) degrades an absent artifact
   to an honest `success:false`, and each handler wraps its own success shape in it. `growth_funnel_build`
   already threw on missing ids (untouched). Two independent reviews (§39 adversarial verifier + §5
   compliance) confirmed no false negatives against the real return shapes and SHIP. **Scope note:**
   the going-live PUBLISH receipts (`growth_page_publish`/`growth_funnel_publish`) and the CRM/scheduling
   write receipts (`crm_log_activity`, `calendar_book_meeting`) carry the same 200-empty-id class and are
   deferred to their own slices (external-publishing = slice 6/7; a write-receipt slice) rather than fixed
   here; the draft-only generators (`growth_page_generate`/`growth_funnel_generate`) persist nothing and
   are correctly excluded. Authenticated owner §32.c live-drive of the deployed edge fn remains owed.
 - **2026-09-05 — Connections treated configured resources as operating and could paint the prior
   workspace during a switch.** The Add-channel candidate originally classified any non-empty
   `default_email_sender` as Connected without reading `default_email_status`, and listed any
   assigned phone number under Operating channels even when `can_send_sms=false` or carrier
   registration was absent. Its best-next card also treated unresolved or failed reads as absence.
   Independent pre-release review found that the identity/readiness hooks returned their prior
   `value` for one render after the active tenant changed, allowing the prior workspace's sender
   address or phone number to appear under the next workspace. Corrected before release: returned
   values/errors are synchronously tenant-matched, recommendation ranking waits for every owning
   read, and only canonically active/send-ready resources count as operating. Delayed-switch and
   independent-source-failure regressions now lock the boundary.
 - **2026-09-05 — the Communications buy flow told the tenant they were being billed; they are not
   (Slice A).** `comms-purchase-number` returns `charge_wired:false` on every exit — the PLATFORM is
   the provider account holder and pays the provider cost for MVP; solo tenants are NOT billed for
   Communications. Yet the `comms_buy_number` tool description ("THIS SPENDS REAL MONEY… the operator
   IS being billed"), the server confirmation prompt ("This starts a recurring charge of $X/month"),
   and the workspace Rail (`_workspace_event_display`: "(monthly charge)" + the unrecorded-outcome
   summary "a charge or a change has landed") all asserted a tenant charge that does not exist — a §13
   falsehood on the `audience:'owner'` Rail. Corrected the BACKEND truthfulness layer (paige-ai-chat
   strings + migration `20261222000000`, which reproduces the Rail function verbatim except the two
   money strings). NO tenant-billing write was created (§38 preserved). The FRONTEND copy
   (`src/solo/settings.tsx`, `NumbersTab.tsx`, `src/lib/integrations/connectError.ts`) carries the same
   claim and is a Claude Design hand-off (§00); the `list_tool_autonomy` toggle label is a parked
   follow-up. Not a permanent pricing decision — "currently platform-provided, no tenant billing
   applied."

 - **2026-09-05 — I counted the MCP surface from tool NAMES and reported the count as measurement.**
   The scoping for the governed MCP door (PR #960) opened with *"70 mutations / 49 reads"*, and that
   number reached the PR body, the seam's own header and a CI comment. It came from matching tool
   names against a mutation-verb pattern, which is exactly the inference the resulting policy file
   forbids. Reading all 119 handler bodies gave **51 reads / 68 mutations** — wrong in both
   directions, and wrong in the expensive one: twenty tools mutate behind read-looking names
   (`handle_data_subject_request` is a GDPR erasure, `suspend_tenant`, `confirm_proposal`,
   `append_client_memory`) while four read-only tools carry write-looking ones (`get_workflow_run`,
   `get_skill_run`, `list_communication_log`, `list_email_send_log`). A name-derived count is not a
   measurement; the same two comments also said the surface had **117** tools when it has **119**,
   which is why `MCP_TOOL_COUNT` is now asserted by CI rather than written in a sentence.
 - **2026-09-05 — the tier matrix said the autonomy lane could not be brought to MCP without
   breaking every write, and it was right; the owner ruled for that cost anyway.** The matrix
   recorded, correctly, that `paige-mcp` performed zero autonomy resolution, and argued against
   closing the gap on the grounds that doing so *"would make every gated MCP write permanently
   un-executable."* That is precisely what the governed door now does, by explicit owner ruling. The
   paragraph is kept rather than deleted: its prediction was accurate, and the entry that matters is
   that the sequence changed rather than the reasoning — the door closes first, the approval channel
   opens second (#47), and refusing an act nobody approved is the safe half to ship alone.
 - **2026-09-03 — I swept for the instance that had just bitten me, not for the class I had just
   learned, and reported it as a sweep.** Commit `eb0dbd83` on #792 was titled *"swept R2 and R3 for
   R1's and R4's blind spot — a NEGATIVE result, asserted"*. The measurement was real and the result
   still holds: neither rule reads a destructurable expression. But **destructuring was the INSTANCE**;
   the class is *a target the guard cannot read*, and I had already named that class with an explicit
   `UNREADABLE_METHOD` sentinel in the sibling MCP guard **one PR earlier**. Independent review found
   the class alive in both rules the sweep had covered: R2 read a dynamic `import(p)` as "not the
   superseded gate", so the #711 bare-boolean gate could have been adopted dynamically with CI green;
   R4 read `client[m]` as "not a data method", so the shared seam could have made its own atomic claim
   undetected. **A sweep is only a sweep if it names the property being swept for.** Mine named a
   syntax. Both now fail closed, with the specifier resolved through the same file first so that
   failing closed costs nothing on the four real dynamic imports in the scan roots.
 - **2026-09-03 — I released a decision-log entry describing a fix, and shipped none of the fix.**
   PR #852 (`759ad8da`) was titled *"The MCP guard's RPC classifier carried its own, shorter removal
   vocabulary"*, carried a full account of the defect and the repair in its body and in the brain
   ledger, and changed **exactly one file: `docs/brain/decision-log.md`.** The lint change was never
   in the commit. It had been made as an uncommitted working-tree edit, and was lost across a branch
   switch I made to rebuild the frontend for an unrelated production check; by the time I ran
   `git add -A` the only modified file left was the ledger.
   **CI passed, and could only have passed:** the guard file was byte-identical to `main`, so its
   existing self-test was green — and my new cases, which would have failed, were not in it either.
   A green suite proves the code it ran; it says nothing about code that never arrived.
   **What caught it was verifying against the RELEASED artifact rather than the merge.** After the
   squash I re-ran the classifier against `origin/main` and the five previously-invisible words still
   returned zero. The self-test said pass and the behaviour said unchanged; the behaviour was right.
   Had I stopped at "CI green, merged", the ledger would now carry a confident, dated, false record
   of a security fix — the precise failure mode §13 exists to prevent, committed in the very entry
   that was correcting a different one.
   **The rule this earns: a claim about a change is worth nothing until the diff is read.** Not the
   PR title, not the commit message, not CI — `git show --stat` on the merged commit. A release whose
   file list does not contain the file the release is about has not happened.
   Fix genuinely shipped in the follow-up; the released head is recorded there.

 - **2026-09-03 — I removed four fabrications from the Solo Trust Compass and introduced three more
   in the same commit, by swapping the DATA under copy I left unchanged.** #831 replaced ten invented
   departments carrying hardcoded trust floats with a real read of `paige_departments` and
   `paige_action_kinds`. The totals the page renders (`tot`, `all`) then counted **catalogue entries**
   — action *types* — while the surrounding sentences still read *"{all} actions this week · {auto}%
   she handled alone"*, *"Today · {tot[0]} performed"*, and, on every orb, *"— auto-performed"* over a
   tier drawn from `Math.random()`. `paige_action_kinds` records no execution and no timestamp, so the
   period, the count of things done, and the past-tense verb were all invented from a table that
   cannot supply any of them. **The lesson is narrower and sharper than "check the copy": replacing a
   fixture with a real read changes what every string ON that surface means, and a caption that was
   true about the fixture is a new fabrication the moment the data underneath it changes.** Two more
   from the same commit: the three header percentage badges were left ungated while the page subtitle
   was gated, so an absent read rendered `null% autopilot … 100% escalated` — a governance claim
   manufactured out of a missing number; and the instruction *"Drag a ring to change autonomy"*
   survived the removal of the drag write it described. **None of these were caught by my own
   verification.** They were found by the independent review requested against the merged commit
   (§39), which is the layer working as designed — and the reason a green proof of the thing I
   thought to test is never a proof of the change. Corrected in the follow-up PR, with each fix
   proven non-vacuous by reverting it and watching a test go red.
 - **2026-09-03 — an honest sentence inside a fabricated frame is still a fabrication.** The widened
   sweep found that #831 had ADDED the correct note — *"nothing in the platform records a day-by-day
   history of what Paige did"* — inside a foldout still titled *"Your trust has grown 14% in 30 days"*
   and subtitled *"Four departments moved outward. None moved back."*, reached by two buttons reading
   `+14%`. **I wrote the disclaimer and left the claim it disclaims wrapped around it.** The frame is
   what the reader sees first, and a note further down does not retract a title. Two more from the
   same family: `MiniCompass` was given the label *"because you have"* by Systems and by the Vault, so
   the rendered sentence credited the workspace for a policy the component's own next line calls "not
   a setting this workspace chose"; and Systems promised *"She will handle this one herself"* from a
   platform-default lane — a lane is a policy, not a commitment about what will happen in a workspace.
 - **2026-09-03 — the same PR read tenant-authored rows into a number captioned "the platform's
   default".** `useSoloTrust` selected `paige_action_kinds` with no `tenant_id` filter. The
   `kind_read` policy is `USING (enabled AND (tenant_id IS NULL OR tenant_id =
   public.current_user_tenant_id()))`, so RLS deliberately returns a workspace's OWN authored kinds
   alongside the platform's. Every row on prod is `tenant_id IS NULL` **today**, and I treated that
   measurement as a guarantee — which is the same mistake in a different costume: a measurement of
   the current data is not a property of the query. The read now filters to `tenant_id IS NULL` and
   the pure builders drop a tenant-authored row independently, so a future query edit cannot silently
   fold a workspace's own policy into a figure that says it is the platform's.

 - **2026-09-02 — a tier gate I shipped as the headline fix did not fix the reported flow, and I said
   so before Gate B rather than after.** The Solo account-context repair (#811) originally led with
   *"`/business/*` had no tier gate; adding one closes the defect."* The first clause is true and the
   hole was real. The second is false: in the reported flow the parked context **is** a sub-account,
   so `/admin` Gate B resolves `tierKey === "sub_account"` and the new gate **allows** it. The gate
   only ever catches a Solo-tier caller at a `/business` URL — a state nothing in the app routes to.
   What actually fixes the flow is the entry rule: a fresh sign-in already asked which workspace
   (`Auth.tsx` + `shouldOfferAccountPicker`), while a RESTORED session came through `/admin` and
   silently resumed whichever context `active_tenant_id` was parked on; `/admin` now runs the same
   shipped predicate. **The failure mode worth naming is not the wrong gate — it is that a plausible
   mechanism was written up as a proven one.** The claim would have survived review: it type-checked,
   it tested green, its own tests passed, and it described a genuine defect. It only fell over when the
   chain was walked end to end from the door the owner actually came through. §70 restated: reading
   that the code is wired is not evidence the person can finish, and a fix for *a* defect is not a fix
   for *the* defect.
 - **2026-09-02 — a scoped test run is not a test run.** The same PR gated `/agency/*` as well, and
   that gate destroyed agency act-as: during a sub-account drill-down `activeTenant` becomes the
   CHILD while authority comes from the PARENT, so a parent-first tier read ejected operators out of
   the `/agency/{parent}/sub/{child}/…` path built to serve them. Two PRE-EXISTING integration tests
   modelled exactly that flow and would have caught it locally — but the local run was scoped to
   `src/solo` and `src/lib/auth`, so CI found it instead. Reverted byte-identical; the hole it was
   reaching for is filed (#814) rather than closed by a guess about a tier outside the brief. The
   habit this replaces: running the tests near the code you touched, when the regression is by
   definition somewhere you were not looking.
 - **2026-09-02 — the §39 peer-gate returned BLOCK on a change whose own suite was green, and was
   right four more times.** Beyond the CI regression it found: a null `activeTenant` on a settled
   context being classified as tier `solo` (a null is "we do not know yet", never a tier — and
   `switchTenant` produces exactly that window, so the guard would have ejected an owner mid-switch);
   `/solo/*` carrying the exact mirror of the hole `/business/*` was being fixed for; a docblock
   claiming the exit control closed the "parked with no way back" half while it is not mounted in the
   shell that strands people; and that control counting a different population than the chooser it
   navigates to, so the button could be a silent round trip. It also caught that the new
   `shouldOfferWorkspaceExit` was a byte-for-byte duplicate of the shipped `shouldOfferAccountPicker`
   (§18). **None of these were reachable from the author's own assertions, which is the entire point
   of the gate** — and the docblock finding is the third time on record that prose in this repository
   asserted a protection the code did not implement.
- **2026-09-01 — multi-tenant email identity and workspace identity were previously collapsed into one redirect.** A Google identity can hold several independent Paige memberships, while the agency parent/sub-account switcher governs a different relationship. The approved correction keeps those authority domains distinct: Google selects the person, Paige intersects that person's active membership rows with RLS-visible tenants, and the existing guarded active-tenant write commits the chosen workspace. This is a Gate 1 implementation record only; live authenticated proof and Gate 2 remain outstanding.

- **2026-09-01 — the Pipeline draft entry still claimed optional starter creation after the owner
  removed every preset pipeline and preset stage.** The implemented creation path is blank-first and
  sends only stages the owner explicitly authors; PAIGE may propose a custom pipeline through the
  governed contract, but no generic sales taxonomy is supplied. Section 5 now states that exact
  contract and also records the canonical one-shell rule for all Solo tenants so an account where a
  defect was observed can never become a separate shell implementation.
- **2026-09-01 — I closed a gate by handing the key to the model. Two reviews, two holes, and the
  second one was mine (branch `codex/paige-knowledge-active-tenant-isolation-v2`, PR #675, NOT
  MERGED).** Recorded in full because the shape of the mistake matters more than the fix.

  **The property that was protecting every write was STRUCTURAL.** The confirm gate's re-entry test
  read `approvedConfirmations`, which arrives only in the validated REQUEST BODY — and a model
  cannot write a request body. Self-approval was impossible by construction, not by instruction.

  **Repair 1 (`20261023000000`) traded that away without noticing.** The echo mechanism it replaced
  was genuinely broken — only one of six chat surfaces sends the echo, so every confirm-gated tool
  had become permanently un-executable on the other five, and the client-portal seat had lost
  `update_client_data`, its only write. The fix returned a `confirm_token` so approval could be
  expressed anywhere. But it returned it **in the tool result**, and the agentic loop feeds tool
  results straight back into the model's own context and issues another round. The model could
  replay its own token and execute — one round after proposing, with no operator — across all 48
  gated tools, including role grants, a permanent workflow delete, and `automation_set_grant`, the
  one tool §67 says Paige must never be able to use on herself. The card the person eventually saw
  was an Approve button for something that had already run.

  **Every test I had written kept passing**, because each supplied the token the way a SURFACE
  would and none ever asked whether the MODEL could supply it. That is the transferable lesson: I
  tested the mechanism I had built rather than the adversary it exists to stop. An independent
  adversarial review driving the real handler found it; no static reading would have.

  **Repair 2 (`20261026000000`) restored a structural floor — and was still not enough.** A proposal
  records the request that minted it; the claim excludes it. That much held: a model cannot start an
  HTTP request, so same-turn self-approval became impossible again. A third review then broke it a
  different way and I reproduced it before acting. **The token is the fingerprint of the ACTION, not
  a secret.** Any LATER request that re-proposed the same call was handed it straight back — and a
  request is just the next message, whatever that message says. Driven, a turn whose human text was
  *"No. Do not do that. Cancel it."* executed the stored write and raised an autonomy grant from
  `confirm` to `auto`. The nonce was never the flaw; **re-issuing the key on demand was.**

  **Repair 3 removes the token rather than patching it, and turns the risk split into a policy.**
  Approval now arrives down two channels the code names and treats differently: a rendered card
  (its fingerprint travels in the request body, which a model cannot write) and `confirm: true` (the
  model's own word). `supabase/functions/_shared/action-risk.ts` decides which channel each action
  needs, from the action alone — 28 `ordinary`, 21 `high` (card only), 2 `owner_only`. `MUTATING_TOOLS`
  is that policy's key set, so the two lists that must agree became one. An unclassified write is
  refused at dispatch and fails CI. Declining a proposal now CANCELS it, instead of leaving it live
  for its full window while the refusal existed only as prose the model had to keep honouring.

  **What repair 3 still does NOT prove, stated because an ambiguous sentence here is how the first
  hole got written:** for an ORDINARY action on a card-less surface, the yes is still model-asserted
  prose. That is the trust level those surfaces have always had, now with the arguments pinned
  server-side, a single-use claim, scope re-checked at redemption, and a decline that actually kills
  the proposal. It is not a proof that a human agreed, and it is not claimed as one — which is
  exactly why nothing irreversible, permission-changing, outward-facing or money-spending is
  reachable that way any more. Building the card on the other five surfaces is the real close-out;
  it is interface work owed to CD (§00).

  **Three transferable rules, each paid for:**
  1. **When a fix removes a structural impossibility and replaces it with an instruction, that is
     the regression** — even when the thing it fixes is real. "Do NOT retry" in a tool result is
     not a gate.
  2. **A test that supplies a credential the way the honest caller would cannot tell you whether a
     dishonest caller could supply it too.** Adversary-shaped fixtures, not just happy-path ones.
  3. **A hole closed twice is a hole whose SHAPE you have not understood yet.** Repair 2 fixed the
     instance the reviewer showed me — same-turn replay — and I treated the class as closed. The
     class was "the model can obtain a redeemable key", and the second review found the other way to
     obtain it in an afternoon. When a fix is scoped to the exact reproduction you were handed, ask
     what the reproduction was an INSTANCE of before calling it done.
  4. **The live catalogue is the source of truth about the live database, not the migration
     history.** Extending the audit trail, I read the migrations, found a tenant-agnostic
     `has_any_role(...)` on SELECT, recognised the §59 trap and wrote a migration justified by
     "any tenant admin can read every tenant's audit rows". Querying production first showed that
     is FALSE — a RESTRICTIVE `tenant_isolation` policy exists on that table that NO migration in
     this repository creates, and being restrictive it ANDs tenant scope onto every read. The real
     defects were different and smaller. A grep of `supabase/migrations/` is not a description of
     prod; the near-miss was shipping a security fix for a vulnerability that did not exist while
     the two that did went unnamed.
  5. **There are TWO system-prompt paths, and the one that matters is the default.** The first
     wiring of the operating memory reached only `FUNDING_SKILL_PROMPT` — the opt-in funding
     skill — while every tenant that has NOT opted in receives `buildNeutralCorePrompt`. So the
     memory landed for the vertical and not for the platform default: §2's exact failure shape,
     and invisible to any check that happened to drive a funding tenant. Both paths are now
     driven by separate checks. When adding anything to the prompt, ask which of the two you
     wired, then wire the other.
  6. **A retrieval that degrades to an empty result can be DEAD for months and look healthy.**
     Three vector searches raised on every call; every caller caught the error and returned `[]`,
     which is the right shape for a retrieval that must never break a conversation and is exactly
     what hid it. "Nothing matched" and "this cannot execute" are the same observation from
     outside. Anything that fails soft needs a check that distinguishes the two — the delivery map
     had INFERRED one of these was broken and inferred the wrong cause; driving it found the real
     one, and two more beside it.
  7. **A test fixture can lie in the direction that makes you feel safe.** The harness's
     service-role `clients` double answered for ANY id and ignored an `eq("tenant_id", …)` filter
     entirely — so every service-role tenant check appeared to pass whether the handler scoped or
     not. A check written against it went green while the handler had genuinely filed a note onto
     another tenant's client. Fixtures that emulate authorization must be at least as strict as
     the thing they emulate, or they grade themselves.
  8. **Mutation-test the fix, not only the feature.** Roughly 40 mutations were driven across this
     branch and they found FOUR vacuous tests — checks passing while reading an empty object, or
     because deleting the code under test made it throw instead of misbehave. Two of those were in
     the very tests written to prove this repair.

- **2026-09-01 — this document asserted that number search was shipped AND that it was the only
  remaining Twilio gap, in three places at once (PR #703 follow-up).** Recording a new capability
  in Section 4 without sweeping for the claims it contradicts produced exactly the failure a single
  source of truth exists to prevent: Section 4 (the Twilio integration header and its "Only
  remaining gap" bullet), Section 5 (the ❌ gap row) and Section 6 (task ledger #27) all still said
  search did not exist, beside a new entry saying it did. Anyone following the mandated daily
  protocol would have got two mutually exclusive answers depending on where they looked.
  **Corrected to what is actually true, rather than to "the gap is closed":** search by area code,
  region, city, digit prefix and toll-free is live, and purchase with it; letter-based **vanity**
  matching is NOT (`starts_with` is stripped to digits, and neither the UI nor
  `comms_search_numbers` exposes a raw Twilio `contains`, so no shipped caller can reach it), nor is
  **premium/registry** search. Task #27 rescoped to those two. Replacing an over-claim with the
  opposite over-claim would have been the same defect wearing different clothes.
  **On the sweep that missed it.** The PR adding the Section 4 entry reported "Section 5 checked for
  a now-stale comms gap: none present". The check ran; it searched `phone number` while the document
  says `phone-number`. One hyphen, and a verification statement that was true of what it searched
  and false of what it claimed. The dated 2026-08-09 entry recording the original narrow-gap
  rescope is deliberately left standing — it was accurate then, and this entry supersedes it rather
  than rewriting the audit trail.
  **The general lesson: an entry that adds a capability is not finished until the claims it
  falsifies are found, and a grep is only as good as its spelling — vary the separator, or the
  absence you prove is the absence of your own pattern.**

- **2026-09-01 — the outbound caller ID was decided by row order, and five defects got past a
  green gate (PRs #695, #699).** `tenant_phone_numbers.is_primary` chooses which number a
  workspace's calls and texts come FROM — `voice-twiml` and `send-message` both order by it — and
  **nothing in the repository had ever written it.** The only `SET is_primary = true` anywhere was
  on `public.businesses`, a different table. Measured on production before the fix: **2 active
  numbers, 0 primaries, 1 workspace** — so that business's outbound calls resolved to whichever row
  Postgres returned and could differ between two calls with no data change. Closed: 0 → 1 primary,
  1 → 0 ambiguous workspaces.
  **The lessons are about the PROOFS, not the code.**
  - **A predicate proof is not a write proof.** The review of #695 tightened the backfill's guard
    and demonstrated it by running the SELECT — with the guard it picks 1 row, without it 0 — and
    never ran the UPDATE. The UPDATE was the half that could fail: `uq_tenant_phone_numbers_primary`
    is `UNIQUE (tenant_id) WHERE is_primary` with no status predicate, so in exactly the state the
    new guard was written for, it aborts `23505`. Fixed in `20261020000000` by making the state
    unreachable (a BEFORE trigger clears the flag when a number leaves `active`) rather than adding
    a third guard.
  - **A schema is not a guard.** `comms_buy_number` marked `monthly_cents` required; tool calling is
    non-strict, so a model could omit it, the executor passed `undefined`, and the seam read that as
    the legacy UI path and bought the number with no price checked or shown. At `auto` there is no
    confirmation at all. The fallback copy — *"an amount Paige could not quote"* — was a graceful
    degrade written where a refusal belonged.
  - **A stable code, not prose.** `number_bought_but_record_failed: <db message>` was compared with
    `===` against the bare token, so on the one path where money had already left, the flag stopping
    Paige offering a replacement purchase was never set. The comment above it said "Carried
    DELIBERATELY", which is what made it look verified.
  - **Count the exits, then count them again.** The purchase audit helper's comment said three
    money-spent exits, already corrected once from one. There are four.
  - **A perturbation that changes nothing proves nothing, and looks exactly like a passing test.**
    Two attempts to break the new assertions came back green and were briefly read as weak
    assertions; both perturbations had simply not applied. Redone with byte offsets printed.
  Guarded by `scripts/comms-purchase-safety-smoke.mjs`, which drives the REAL handler and is wired
  unconditionally into CI — and was confirmed to have actually executed on the runner, since a step
  whose script path did not match would be silently green.

- **2026-09-01 — the tool catalogue is a VALUES list, so the LAST migration decides what the
  operator can switch off (PR #695).** `list_tool_autonomy` re-declares its whole catalogue on every
  touch. A branch whose catalogue migration sorted BEFORE two that landed on main while it was open
  would have installed four governed `Comms` rows and had main's later migrations drop them again —
  leaving a **paid action governed-but-invisible**, with `lint:tool-catalogue` green throughout,
  because the lint reads the last declaration and would have found them absent there. Caught only
  because `capabilities.v3.test.tsx` conflicted and, resolved on arithmetic, then failed. Rebuilt at
  a timestamp that sorts last. **When a migration REPLACES rather than adds, its position is part of
  its correctness.**

- **2026-09-01 — this document went unupdated across four merged PRs (#692, #693, #695, #699).**
  §0 binds the master reference to the SAME PR as the ship. Those four updated
  `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` (§66) instead and treated it as sufficient. §0 and §66 bind
  DIFFERENT documents, and this is the one that answers *"do we already have this?"* — so the entire
  Solo comms capability was absent from it while being live in production. Recorded here rather than
  quietly backfilled, because the failure mode is the doc silently lagging reality.
- **2026-08-30 — the honesty of a compliance surface rested on nobody exercising a policy
  (PR #672, owner-approved).** `tenant_a2p_registrations`' RLS UPDATE and INSERT policies are
  row-scoped with **no column restriction**, so a tenant admin could set `submitted_at` and a
  brand SID straight through PostgREST and make the surface render *"Submitted for review —
  you'll be notified the moment it's approved"* for a registration nothing was ever sent for.
  An earlier commit of mine called `submitted_at` "the discriminator only a real submission
  path may set"; that was true of every shipped code path and **not enforced by the database**.
  `20261004030000` closes it: a SECURITY INVOKER trigger fails closed for every direct caller
  on the eight submission-owned columns, INSERT as well as UPDATE. **The general lesson: "no
  shipped path does this" is a statement about today's code, not a property of the system —
  if a claim about what cannot happen is load-bearing for honesty, enforce it where the data
  lives.**
  **And a partial enforcement invites the same mistake one column over.** `030000` protected
  the eight submission columns and left the seven DRAFT columns unconditionally editable by a
  direct caller — saying so in its own header — so an approved, carrier-linked registration's
  `sample_messages` could still be rewritten while the tab said its copy was locked.
  `20261004040000` freezes those seven once `a2p_registration_is_immutable(old)`. A review
  then executed a rewrite of `id` and `created_at` on a frozen row and it SUCCEEDED, orphaning
  the `paige_audit_log.target_id` link; `20261004050000` freezes those at all stages. **Count
  the columns the guarantee claims to cover, then count the ones the guard names. Twice here
  the difference was where the hole was.**
  **A third time, in the reason given for the last omission.** `050000` left `tenant_id` out
  because the update policy's `WITH CHECK` "already refuses a NULL or foreign value" — true of a
  tenant admin, false of a platform operator, because that policy reads
  `is_platform_owner() OR (tenant_id = … AND …)`, which is true for an operator whatever the
  column holds, so the tenant_id test can never refuse their write. That is the disjunction's
  truth value, not a claim about an evaluation order PostgreSQL does not guarantee. A review
  measured an operator both NULLing and reassigning a carrier-approved registration, which moves
  a live `messaging_service_sid` onto another business with no audit row — carrying the same
  qualification the tier matrix and the capability map carry: the reassign lands only on a tenant
  that holds no registration of its own, because onto an occupied one the unique constraint
  refuses the write first. That is why the proof pins the refusal HINT rather than the refusal
  alone; "refused" by itself would pass with the guard deleted. `20261004060000` closes it.
  **A delegation is a claim about the thing you delegated to — check that thing, do not restate
  what you assume it does.**

- **2026-08-30 — a durable write turned a dormant lie into the default (PR #665).** `A2PTab`'s
  banner and status pills keyed on *"a row exists with no carrier SID"* and rendered **"Submitted for
  review — you'll be notified the moment it's approved."** That was survivable only while nothing
  wrote the row. The same PR made the draft save durable, writing exactly that shape
  (`status='pending'`, no SIDs), so the false claim went from unreachable to the **normal result of
  clicking "Draft with Paige"** — on a compliance surface, over a registration nobody had filed, with
  no mechanism that could ever notify anyone. Corrected to key on `submitted_at`, which no shipped
  path sets. **The general lesson: making a backend honest is incomplete until whatever RENDERS it is
  re-checked against the new reality.** A copy string that was true under the old behaviour is not
  automatically true under the new one.

- **2026-08-30 — a migration version collision would have skipped a migration on prod, silently
  (PR #665).** #666 landed `20261004000000_analytics_evidence_bundle.sql`, sharing a version prefix
  with #665's migration — the only duplicate across 836 files. `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`
  is keyed on the VERSION, and `db push` applies only versions it lacks, so the second migration would
  never have run on production while CI, the `db-live` tag and every badge stayed green — and the edge
  functions, which do deploy, would have called a function that was never created. The clean replay
  cannot catch this: it iterates FILES and dedupes only the recorded row, so both run locally.
  **Check the migration version namespace on every re-ground**; renamed to `20261004010000`.

- **2026-08-30 — "all assertions passed" said nothing about the fix it was written for (PR #665).**
  Three separate times a green proof measured something other than what it named: negative cases
  passed an empty sample array so validation refused them before the guard under test ran; the
  anonymous-caller case ran as `anon`, which holds no EXECUTE grant, so the grant refused it and the
  in-body check was never reached (§59 inverted); and reverting the entire owner-locked D2 concurrency
  mechanism left every assertion green. Also: a structural pin on function TEXT was defeated by a
  rewrite that kept the matched literal and added a redirect one line later, scoring 13/13 while
  running a full cross-tenant IDOR. **Boundaries are measured, never described** — every trace a
  foreign caller could leave, plus the RETURN VALUE, since a read-only escape writes nothing.

- **2026-08-28 — a Clients subtab must not grow a second Clients header.** Solo Conversations owns
  only the canvas below the shared `People · Conversations · Calendar · Portal` strip. A route-local
  “Your client book,” “Client conversations,” status banner, or decorative hero duplicates the shell,
  consumes the form-fit budget, and violates the owner-approved hierarchy. Regression coverage now
  forbids those labels in the Solo Conversations mount and scopes ancestor-chrome suppression to the
  Conversations descendant only; People-owned wrapper files remain untouched.

- **2026-08-18 — "latent structural weakness rather than a confirmed live leak" was too optimistic.**
  `docs/doctrine/role-taxonomy-and-matrix.md` §4 hedged that most reads also filter by tenant via RLS,
  so the mis-scoped global grants were a latent weakness. **R1 found a LIVE platform-seam escalation**
  (`paige_workflow_registry`: 23 platform rows, PERMISSIVE `cmd=ALL`, guard collapsing to a global
  `admin` held by ~every tenant owner). The taxonomy doc's caveat that this "is not proven safe
  either — that is exactly what the audit must establish per call site" was the operative half; the
  reassuring half was wrong. Corrected by R1 + fixed by R2a in the same PR.


Things Cowork/CC/Codex have claimed that the codebase disagrees with. **Never remove entries** — mark as reversed/resolved but keep the record. **CC's code check is authoritative.**

- **2026-08-17 · Route + URL Taxonomy authored (§65, docs-only) + `/admin` 4-way-overload correction + §-numbering decision.** The owner ruled the Route + URL Taxonomy (2026-08-17): `/admin` was the login target for FOUR account types at once (Solo + Sub-account + Agency + God), which is why the agency owner kept "landing on the same page" — a **naming-debt** defect (one internal route overloaded across four user mental models), NOT an auth bug. Authored `docs/doctrine/route-and-url-taxonomy.md` (the §18 one home) with the LOCKED 6-row matrix (Operator `/operator` · Agency `/agency/{account}` · Enterprise `/enterprise/{account}` · Solo `/solo/{account}` · Sub-account `/business/{account}` · Client `/portal/:tenantSlug`), per-account unique numeric URL (net-new `account_number`, address-NOT-grant), shared-shell design (solo+business one shell; agency+enterprise one shell + Enterprise customizations, §60), producer blast-radius, and the staged redirect-safe migration order (R0 substrate → R1 Operator → R2 Agency+Enterprise[folds the `agency_login_default='last_account'` workaround revert] → R3 Solo+Business → R4 retire redirects). **TWO RULINGS LOCKED (owner, 2026-08-17):** (1) **`account_number` = offset/scrambled** — a random unused 7-digit number (reveals no tenant count or signup order in URLs), NOT raw sequential; permanent per account for life (survives tier promotion, vanity edits, redirects). (2) **Act-as URLs are actor-namespaced** — `/operator/act-as/{n}/{branch}` and `/agency/{n}/sub/{subN}/{branch}` encode the ACTOR, so §51 impersonation audit + Paige's §32.c self-awareness read straight off the URL. Both firm; do not re-open unless a §32.c live-drive surfaces something the design doesn't survive. **R0-substrate BUILT** (CI-deploys on merge; §32.b persisted-apply confirm owed): `src/lib/routing/tierBranches.ts` (config-as-data route-tree registry) + migration `20260916000000` (`account_number` column + generator + assign-on-insert trigger + 13-tenant backfill; §32.a proof green + rolled back). **URL-segment refinement (owner, same day):** born NUMERIC at creation (`account_number`, permanent — don't assume the owner's name spelling/branding at signup), then a **self-serve vanity-URL editor** inside the account lets them switch the segment to their name/company; the resolver accepts either, with uniqueness + reserved-word denylist + old→new 301 grace (§58) + the number always still resolving; §10-callable so Paige can rename it too. Tracked as its own implementation slice. **UNIFORM-BACKFILL ruling (owner, same day):** treat EVERY existing account as brand-new — the R0 backfill assigns a fresh `account_number` to every account on the platform by the same rule a new signup uses, with ZERO grandfathering of any current slug / vanity URL (owner: *"I don't care who has a current vanity URL… treat every single account as if they are a brand new account."*); anyone wanting a vanity sets one via the editor after the numbering is live. Removes all "grandfather existing slugs" complexity from the migration. **§-numbering DECISION:** the CLAUDE.md naming-consistency anchor took **§65** (next free anchor; §66 free, §67 reserved for Paige self-knowledge / task #159) — PROPOSED wording, owner ratifies exact text in a later pass (same pattern as §57–§64). **SCOPE (owner-ruled):** this is a **docs-only** PR — taxonomy + matrix + migration order ONLY, **ZERO code renames**; the owner reviews the taxonomy + migration order BEFORE any code-rename slice fires (§58 old routes stay redirect-alive through the whole migration). Anchoring naming-debt cases logged in `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` §15: (a) Solo vs `account_type='standalone'`, (b) "PME Enterprise"-in-name vs `account_type='agency'` (owner: "PME is NOT an Enterprise account 😂"), (c) `/admin` overload. Cross-refs §36/§51/§56/§60/§61/§9/§58/§18.
- **2026-08-16 · Solo shell activation red-lines FIXED (merged #505) + §57 runtime toggle + FIRST canary activated.** The faithful-port shell (#503) carried three doctrine red-lines that blocked activation; owner ruled "CC fixes it all now." Fixed + merged (PR #505): **§63** — all owner-real-account fixtures anonymized to a fictional identity (Antonio Cook→Jordan Avery; Project Mogul Enterprise/Mogul Maker Academy→Meridian Advisory; setup entities→Meridian Advisory LLC/Meridian Coaching/Meridian Holdings LLC; "Provided by Project Mogul Enterprise"→"Provided by Northwind Partners"; vendor→Northwind Partners); re-grep = zero. **§2** — marketplace hero is now coaching-generic; funding survives ONLY as one opt-in Playbook card (`state:'get'`), never a default; re-grep = zero finance-default copy. **§57** — the `Admin.tsx` mount was converted from the build-time `VITE_SOLO_SHELL_ENABLED` env flag (tier-wide, un-canary-able, un-flippable) to a **runtime per-tenant flag `tenants.features.solo_shell_enabled`** read via `useTenantContext` from the ACTIVE tenant's own features only (§51/§9-safe); strict `tierKey==='solo' && soloStandalone` gate preserved (Super-Admin/God keeps its own SEPARATE design — owner-ruled 2026-08-16 — and can never render this shell; an operator has `activeTenantId===null` ⇒ flag false). Also: button-in-button nesting fixed + ⌘K wired to a real keydown handler. Verified: §39 adversarial diff read + §32.c headless render drive of the anonymized `<SoloApp/>` (14/14 surfaces, 0 pageErrors; home/marketplace/setup visually confirmed). **CANARY (owner order: empty → `mogul-credit-company` → `first-sterling-capital` LAST):** `paige-operator-workspace` (d1f0a7e2, empty, §63-sanctioned) ACTIVATED via DB flag 2026-08-16. **The two REAL tenants are HELD (§58/§13):** the shell is still FIXTURE-ONLY (zero supabase/tenant-data reads in `src/solo`), so activating a real account replaces its owner's real dashboard with the fictional Jordan-Avery/Meridian mockup — a §58 capability-hiding regression that requires explicit owner acknowledgment before flipping `mogul-credit-company`/`first-sterling-capital`. Data-wiring the shell to real tenant data is the tracked next phase. **§32.c HONEST caveat:** the authenticated PRODUCTION render was NOT driven headless (SSO/auth limit) — proven by the fixture drive + DB-flag verification; the live authenticated look is owed to an owner live-drive or a Cowork/Chrome drive.
- **2026-08-16 · Solo shell faithful port BUILT (merged #503) + §51 tier-design CORRECTION.** The Claude Design "Solo workspace" pack was faithfully ported into `src/solo/**` (13 fixture-data screens incl. Calendar+webinars) and mounted as a flag-gated (`VITE_SOLO_SHELL_ENABLED`, default OFF) `Admin.tsx` takeover for STRICT solo-standalone tenants only. **CORRECTION (owner-ruled 2026-08-15):** the earlier Cowork reading that *"sub-accounts inherit the Solo shell verbatim per §60"* is **REVERSED**. Claude Design leads the UI for **every tier independently** — Solo is Solo, sub-account/Agency/God each get their OWN design pack (owner-gated, handed over separately). §60 same-tier parity now governs **feature availability** (what capabilities exist), NOT **visual/interaction design** (which derives per-tier from Claude Design's canonical mockup per tier). The Solo mount therefore gates on `tierKey==='solo' && soloStandalone` and can NEVER render for sub-account/Agency/Enterprise/God. **HONEST state (§13):** BUILT + merged + flag OFF = live-capable but NOT activated — prod render is byte-unchanged (§58, lazy code-split); the shell shows fixture data (real data wiring is a later phase) and activation + the §32.c live-drive of the auth-gated shell are **owner-gated** (canary: empty tenants → `mogul-credit-company` → `first-sterling-capital` LAST, it has real data). §63 faithful-port lint exemptions scoped to `src/solo/**` only.
- **2026-08-15 · Task #126 Slice 3b BUILT — `browse_public_url` skill + interpreter public-browse dispatch + tenant-scoped `paige_browser_usage` write; TWO §13 corrections + one §18 producer-scope decision.** The 3b build wired the Slice-3a `/browse-public-url` endpoint into a real Paige skill (own PR). Corrections logged per §0/§13:
  - **CORRECTION 1 (the build brief's `category: research` is INVALID).** The Slice 3b brief specified `category: research` for the skill. That value does **NOT** exist in the 12-value canonical `paige_skills` category enum (locked by `paige_skills_category_canonical_chk`, migration `20260830000000`): vision_strategy · client_delivery · sales_growth · marketing_content · documents · analytics_interpretation · team_management · financial_ops · compliance_legal · operations_process · agent_orchestration · superpowers. Seeding `research` would throw the CHECK at apply time. Reading a public page is an operations/quality mechanic → **`operations_process`** is the correct best fit (same bin as `verify_deployed_surface`). The §32.a proof re-confirmed the row inserts cleanly under `operations_process`.
  - **CORRECTION 2 (§18 producer scope — the brief's per-surface producer list resolves to ONE audited home, not three forks).** The brief listed `paige-ai-chat` + `subagent-market-research` + `paige-mcp` as producer surfaces to wire. The §18/§30 diagnostic found the ONE audited producer already exists: `run_skill` (paige-mcp → skill-runner → interpreter) is generic and already forwards the server-resolved tenant + `invoker_user_id`, so `browse_public_url` is reachable + writes its `paige_browser_usage` row the moment it seeds, with **zero per-surface code**. Forking a direct `/browse-public-url` call into paige-ai-chat or a subagent would **bypass the audit write (§9) and fork the host seam (§18)** — a regression, not a deliverable. So the producer wiring is the generic path (done); exposing skills in the primary `paige-ai-chat` inline tool loop is a broader capability (all seeded skills, not just browse) DEFERRED to its own slice + §32 pass. `subagent-content-drafter` remains owner-ruling (deferred). §37-honest: `pickBrowserStep` now excludes `mode:"public"`, which no existing seeded skill uses → `verify_deployed_surface` byte-unchanged (§58).
  - **Verification GREEN:** 35 unit tests, tsc 0, `lint:{views,definer-fns,tier-features}` clean; §32.a rollback proofs on prod (skill + Trust Compass row + audit-write shape, all rolled back); §39 peer-gate ran on the real diff. §32.a persisted-apply + §32.c live-drive OWED post-merge (no Deno to type-check edge files here — #142; no browser to drive — §32.c capability-conditional).
- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 Slice 3a BUILT — SSRF-hardened primitive + Phase-1 denylist + wildcard flag (OFF) + `paige_browser_usage` rail; TWO §13 corrections to the build paste.** The 3a build shipped the D1=(c) safety net (own PR, code-only + one migration). Along the way it corrected TWO inaccuracies in the Cowork build paste — logged here per §0/§13:
  - **CORRECTION 1 (guard was NOT "localhost-only").** The paste's premise — *"Slice 1's guard only blocks localhost… extend to block private ranges / 169.254 / IPv6 / mapped"* — was **wrong**. CC's read of `services/paige-browser/server.js` (the §30 diagnostic) proved the base guard **already** blocked all private IPv4 (10/172.16/192.168), loopback (127/::1), link-local + **cloud-metadata `169.254.169.254`**, IPv6 ULA/link-local (fc00::/7, fe80::/10), the `::ffff:` dotted IPv4-mapped form, and enforced an http(s)-only scheme allowlist, PLUS a per-request `page.route` interceptor + a post-redirect `final_url` re-check. So 3a is an **extension** (§18/§30), NOT the from-scratch SSRF build the paste implied. What 3a genuinely ADDED: granular **reason codes** (`ssrf:link-local:metadata` etc. for the audit rail), the missing **reserved/broadcast/multicast** ranges (0/8, 224/4, 240/4, 192.0.0.0/24, TEST-NETs, 198.18/15), the **6to4 / NAT64 / hex-IPv4-mapped** embedded-v4 tunnels, and the two-layer content denylist + wildcard flag. The numeric-encoding bypass class (decimal/hex/octal/short-form) was **already closed** by WHATWG `new URL()` normalization — verified, not re-coded (locked by `smoke-ssrf.mjs`). The guard was extracted to a shared `ssrf-guard.mjs` (§18 one home; the smoke tests the REAL code, §32) — the consolidation seam for #138 (the guard is still duplicated in `visual-renderer`).
  - **CORRECTION 2 (the Fly host does NOT write the audit row — the caller does).** The paste's D4 said *"paige-browser writes via service role."* That **contradicts** the host's deliberate, owner-signed-off **DB-free** architecture (`server.js` lines 16-19: the host holds NO Supabase creds; the ledger write + tenant-scope resolution live in the CALLING edge function). Reversing it would be a real §9 regression — an SSRF/RCE on the browser host would then reach a service-role DB key. So 3a keeps the host DB-free: it returns a structured `blocked_reason` + timing, and the **`paige_browser_usage` table + RLS ship now** (the operator audit rail, per the brief) while the **row-WRITE is wired in the Slice 3b caller** where `tenant_id` is resolved from the verified JWT (§9/§53). Consequence (§37-honest): in 3a the table has **zero writers yet** and the `/browse-public-url` endpoint has **zero producers** until 3b's skill lands — both are correct-by-design, not a gap.
  - **Denylist strategy (owner-ruled 2026-08-12), two-layer defense-in-depth:** **Layer 1** = Cloudflare for Families (`1.1.1.3`/`1.0.0.3`) set as the container resolver via a Dockerfile entrypoint — a category-blocked domain resolves to `0.0.0.0`, which the guard's `0.0.0.0/8` rule already denies (reason `denylist:cloudflare-families`); **Layer 2** = a StevenBlack/hosts snapshot baked into the image (`fakenews-gambling-porn`), parsed into a Set, parent-domain matched (reason `denylist:stevenblack`). Neither is hand-rolled (§14). **HONEST caveat (§13):** Layer-1's live efficacy depends on Fly honoring the resolv.conf rewrite — the §39 **live** peer-gate (a Families-blocked domain against the DEPLOYED host) is the gate that confirms it; if it fails, the fast-follow is a Node Families resolver. Layer-2 + the private-IP guard are code-reliable regardless. **Roadmap forward:** Phase 2 = per-tenant declared denylist (NextDNS-style) = Slice 3e (deferred); Phase 3 = enterprise-tier = a later unnamed slice.
  - **Wildcard stays OFF (§32.c):** `PAIGE_BROWSER_WILDCARD_ENABLED` defaults false; `/browse-public-url` refuses any non-`paigeagent.ai` URL with 403 `capability_disabled` until an owner flips it AFTER the live peer-gate returns SHIP. `/self-verify` (Slice 2) is byte-unchanged (§58). Headless proofs GREEN: 60 SSRF-guard cases (exact reason codes, incl. numeric-encoding + userinfo normalization + denylist fixture) + the §32.b migration proof. OWED to the §39 LIVE peer-gate: the real deployed-host proofs (metadata IP denied, redirect-to-private, Families sinkhole, positive control) — not claimed headless.
  - **§39 peer-gate ran ITERATE (independent adversarial read of the real diff) — 3 findings, ALL fixed before merge:** (i) **HIGH** — the append-only *immutability trigger* would also fire on FK **CASCADE** actions, making a browsed tenant un-offboardable + an authoring user un-deletable (§38/GDPR). Fixed: dropped the trigger; append-only is now enforced at the **grant level** (REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE from every role — cascades are system-privileged and bypass grants), matching the `paige_llm_trace` precedent. Re-proven (§32.b): `triggers=0·grants=[authenticated:SELECT, service_role:INSERT+SELECT]·service_role INSERT ok·service_role DELETE blocked·rolled back clean`. (ii) **LOW-MED** — the wildcard flag gated only the INITIAL host, so a `*.paigeagent.ai` open-redirect could run the wildcard capability while OFF. Fixed: `browsePublic` now re-asserts `WILDCARD_ENABLED || isSelfTarget(finalHost)` on the post-redirect host, not just the SSRF/denylist guard. (iii) **MED §13** — comments/README claimed the denylist is "refreshed weekly by CI," but that workflow doesn't exist yet. Fixed: copy corrected to "build-time snapshot, refreshed on image rebuild"; the scheduled weekly refresh is filed as task #151. Confirmed clean by the peer-gate: SSRF guard (no reachable-internal bypass across the full matrix), `/self-verify` §58, migration RLS §9/§53, §2/§3/§50 copy.
- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 Slice 3 SCOPE RATIFIED (owner ruling) — public-web browsing, D1 = wildcard+denylist (owner OVERRODE the "never (c)" recommendation).** Slice 3 extends the paige-browser primitive from the fixed `paigeagent.ai` self-verify to **arbitrary public URLs** (research on a tenant's behalf, verify tenant-owned surfaces). It introduces **real new risk classes** the earlier "same pipe, wider allowlist, no new risk ground" framing UNDERSTATED — SSRF, URL injection, content leakage, cost blowout, cross-tenant surface. Owner's ratified scope:
  - **D1 = (c) WILDCARD + DENYLIST — owner-ruled OVERRIDE of the Cowork recommendation (which was D1=(a) platform-only / "never (c)").** Owner's rationale: *research-assistant capability requires open-web access; an allowlist would bottleneck the product before value shows.* **Mitigations owner attached (all binding):** (1) Slice 3a full SSRF hardening ships as a **HARD PREREQUISITE**; (2) the wildcard capability stays **feature-flagged OFF until the 3a §39 peer-gate returns SHIP**; (3) the denylist is **sourced from a maintained third-party categorization service** (Cloudflare for Families `1.1.1.3`, OpenDNS FamilyShield, NextDNS, or a maintained public blocklist like StevenBlack/hosts) — **NOT hand-rolled** (the point: someone whose full-time job is maintaining it keeps it current).
  - **D2 = RATIFIED** — a NEW `browse_public_url` skill (one URL in, read-only structured content out); leaves `verify_deployed_surface` untouched (§58).
  - **D3 = RATIFIED** — structured JSON default; optional `include_screenshot` flag **reuses the already-deployed `visual-renderer` service** (§18 one home, cheaper than adding screenshot code to paige-browser).
  - **D4 = RATIFIED + TIGHTENED** (because D1=(c) removes the natural allowlist ceiling) — per-tenant rate limit (**conservative, ~60 calls/hr default**), 30s hard per-request timeout, `paige_browser_usage` log up front (§17 Engine-2 metered rail). Reason: open web means a "check my top 100 competitors" prompt could burn a thousand Fly minutes fast.
  - **Sub-slicing RATIFIED:** **3a** (SSRF-hardened primitive — migration-free, code-only; the wildcard flag is OFF at merge) → **3b** (denylist + `browse_public_url` skill) → **3c** (cost/concurrency ceiling); **3d** (per-tenant allowlist authoring, i.e. the original D1(b)) **DEFERRED**.
  - **3a peer-gate = LIVE PROOF, not unit tests (§32.c):** `169.254.169.254` (cloud-metadata — the credential-leak gate; a *silently-succeeding* fetch is a FAIL), `10.x`, `127.0.0.1`, `file://`, and a **hostile-DNS-resolves-to-private-IP-mid-redirect** must ALL return **DENIED** against the ACTUAL deployed paige-browser, not a mock. Resolve-to-IP FIRST, re-check on every redirect. (DNS-rebinding hardening is also tracked as #138 across BOTH browser services.)
  - **§13 honest note for the builder:** the existing paige-browser SSRF guard is already non-trivial (private IPv4 + link-local/metadata + CGNAT + IPv6 ULA/link-local + scheme allowlist + a `page.route` per-request re-check + post-redirect `final_url` re-check) — 3a EXTENDS/HARDENS it (adds the third-party denylist, the feature flag, and closes any remaining gaps incl. DNS-rebind), it does NOT rebuild from zero (§18/§30). Cross-refs: §9, §13, §17, §18, §32.c, §34 L1 (log every browse), §37, §39, §58, §64.
- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 stale-pricing = BRANCH A (live-site defect), §32.c integrity REAFFIRMED + a §39 miss owned → killed the §18 duplication at the root.** The owner caught that `verify_deployed_surface` returned STALE pricing ($27/$67/$297 "Founding Beta") on `https://paigeagent.ai` — the one thing wrong; hero/security/CTAs current. A full Branch-A vs Branch-B diagnostic + an INDEPENDENT §39 peer-gate (a second agent that re-derived from scratch + ran its own live fetch) confirmed **BRANCH A: a live-site content defect, NOT a live-drive integrity defect.** Proof: `paige-browser` has ONE content source — `page.goto(url)` (no mock/fixture/cache/URL-rewrite; the Fly image copies only `package.json`+`server.js`); the stale figures existed **nowhere** in the repo or the deployed React bundle (which carried current `$149/$397`) — ONLY in the live-served `index.html` static skeleton inside `#root`, which a `networkidle` headless read resolves against BEFORE React (createRoot) clears `#root`. The decisive tell eliminating Branch B: `paige-browser` could only have obtained `$27/$297` by *actually fetching live prod*. **§32.c GREEN HOLDS — the tool's first live use CAUGHT a real defect; Slice 3 was never compromised.** **The real §39 miss belongs to PR #280** (it changed pricing in `src/components/landing/PricingSection.tsx` but left the DUPLICATE `index.html` skeleton stale — a §18 two-homes drift no peer-gate caught until the owner did). **Owner ruling (2026-08-12): KILL the duplication, don't sync-and-guard.** Fix (this PR): (i) **de-duplicated** the skeleton — it now carries only stable SEO copy (hero H1 + value-prop + CTA), all product content in React alone; (ii) **tightened the Slice 2 selector** — `verify_deployed_surface` now waits on `[data-app-ready]` (a React-only post-hydration marker), never `h1` (which the skeleton also had), so a skeleton false-positive is structurally impossible — this is the deeper **verdict-strength lesson**: the earlier "GREEN" could reflect skeleton content because the wait predicate was too permissive; (iii) added `lint:skeleton` CI guard (any-duplicated-content whitelist, §24) so the leak class cannot recur. Verified: build green, guard passes clean + fails on injected drift (red-then-green), marker present in `main.tsx` and absent from `index.html`, migration JSON valid.
- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 Slice 2 reached §32.c GREEN — the Playwright caret-drift bug + three §13 corrections.** After the operator-tenant fix (below) landed, Cowork's live-drives still infra-blocked; the honest verdicts named a Playwright/Docker version mismatch, and the owner then drove `https://paigeagent.ai` through `verify_deployed_surface` end-to-end and got **real live content** (full hero, pricing table, security copy, CTAs) — **§32.c GREEN, no further post-deploy scan owed.** Three §13 corrections logged: **(a) OVER-CLAIM (Cowork):** an earlier "redeployed cleanly" was asserted on a `/healthz` 200 alone — which proves the *service* is up, NOT which Playwright version the *container* actually runs. The real defect (npm 1.62 vs image 1.48) only surfaced on the live browser launch. Lesson: healthz-200 ≠ correct-container-version (the container twin of §32's "compiled ≠ ran"). **(b) ROOT CAUSE:** both browser services pinned `"playwright": "^1.48.0"` (a CARET), so the Fly build resolved npm to the latest 1.x (~1.62) while the Docker base stayed `v1.48.0-jammy`; Playwright 1.55+ launches Chromium via a `chromium-headless-shell` binary the 1.48 image does not ship → launch failed on three live-drives. Fix: EXACT-pin the npm package = base image, in lockstep, so a caret/Dependabot bump of one side can never re-open the gap. **(c) SELF-CORRECTION (CC, this session):** PR #494 (my earlier merge) pinned `1.56.1` — reasoned as the repo-canonical version — but Cowork had already deployed + the owner PROVED `1.62.1` working LIVE, so the repo (`1.56.1`) briefly diverged from proven prod (`1.62.1`). Corrected here: the repo is aligned **UP** to the proven-live `1.62.1` across ALL THREE pins (root live-drive devDep + both Fly services + both `v1.62.1-jammy` base images) — §18 one-canonical-version preserved (the root has no committed lockfile and CI uses `npm install`, so the root bump is `npm install`-safe). The repo now matches what is deployed and proven. **Slice 3 (public-web browsing) is GREENLIT** — same pipe, wider allowlist, no new risk ground. (NOTE: the `docs/doctrine/paige-c-suite-roster.md` "both added" merge conflict the handoff flagged is COWORK-environment-local — `main` is clean, no conflict markers here — so nothing in the canonical repo needs resolving; flagged to the owner separately, untouched per §28.)

- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 Slice 2 §32 CONFIRMED + §32.c live-drive exposed a platform-scope tenant-resolution gap → operator-workspace hotfix (PR #492).** FIRST, resolving the entry below: **Slice 2's §32 persisted-apply is CONFIRMED on prod** — `schema_migrations` advanced to `20260912000000`, the `verify_deployed_surface` row is live with the correct gating fields (`auto`+`read_only`, browser step → `https://paigeagent.ai`), and `git diff db-live..HEAD` is empty (zero drift). Then Cowork fired the §32.c FIRST FULL-LOOP live-drive (`run_skill verify_deployed_surface`) — Paige returned an HONEST `cancelled` / `tenant_unresolved` (textbook §13 honest-degrade, not a fabricated verdict), which SURFACED a real gap before Slice 3 could multiply it. **§30 scout diagnosis (two compounding defects; the interpreter/`run_skill`/§200-resolver chain was otherwise correctly built):** (1) `admin_app_settings.platform_operator_tenant_id` pointed at a **§200 PHANTOM** tenant (`94af805c…`, no such row) — the resolver correctly failed closed to null; (2) `paige-mcp actorTenantId()` only fell back to `platformOperatorTenantId()` on the platform-KEY branch, so the sole operator (`admin@paigeagent.ai`, a tenant-less super_admin USER — `active_tenant_id` null, 0 memberships) resolved null → `tenant_unresolved`. **Fix (owner-ruled 2026-08-12: create a dedicated operator workspace) — migration `20260913000000`:** a coaching-generic, top-level **standalone** `Paige Operator Workspace` tenant with `features.system_workspace=true` (the established §57 system-tenant marker — excludes it from the managed-email connector + onboarding systems-check, and from fleet/revenue aggregates that honor the flag), re-pointing the setting at it (config-as-data; `DO UPDATE` required to replace the existing phantom row); plus `actorTenantId()` now falls back to the SAME resolver for a platform-**owner** USER with no tenant (§18 one home — non-owner tenant-less users still resolve null, byte-identical). **§1 crew: build + adversarial §39 peer-gate (SHIP — full 56-site `actorTenantId()` consumer inventory: NO cross-tenant leak, the only cross-tenant paths gate on `actorIsPlatformOwner()` not `actorTenantId()`, and the workspace is fresh/empty/childless) + compliance (SHIP — §2/§9/§51/§57/§200 clean).** **§32.a rollback proof RAN GREEN against prod** (`OPTENANT_PROOF exists=1 std=1 parent_null=1 sysws=1 setting_ok=1 → ROLLBACK_PROOF_OK`, all provisioning triggers fired without throwing, nothing persisted). **§32 post-merge persisted-apply CONFIRMED on prod (2026-08-12, PR #492 merged as `0b8bd563`):** `schema_migrations` at `20260913000000` (latest — zero drift, `git diff db-live..origin/main` empty), the operator workspace tenant is LIVE (`standalone`, `features.system_workspace=true`), `platform_operator_tenant_id` re-pointed to it (`d1f0a7e2…`, phantom gone), and BOTH pipelines green — deploy-migrations + deploy-edge-functions (the latter redeployed `paige-mcp` with the `actorTenantId` fallback, so Half A is live too). **STILL OWED:** Cowork RE-FIRES `run_skill verify_deployed_surface` → expects a real Fork-8 verdict on paigeagent.ai (the first true end-to-end proof of the whole browser wave). Follow-ups filed: the pre-existing L1549 `.eq("slug","mma")` fallback for non-owner tenant-less users (§63/§200 latent, task #147), and setting `owner_user_id` on the workspace for full operator dogfooding (#148). **Slice 3 stays BLOCKED until Cowork's re-drive returns a real verdict.**

- **2026-08-12 · Doctrine amendment PROPOSED (§63) — owner's real business accounts off-limits as agent example/default/suggestion targets; audit found ZERO example-misuse to scrub.** Owner ruled (2026-08-12) that Cowork + CC must NEVER use the owner's REAL production accounts — Project Mogul (agency), Mogul Maker Academy / MMA (sub-account), Antonio Daniel LLC (sub-account) — as an example tenant, default, suggestion, fork option, or negative-comparison target. Filed as **CLAUDE.md §63 PROPOSED** (extends §9/§57; go-forward CHOOSING rule, not a purge — legitimate historical audit/logic/portfolio refs are NEVER removed, §58). When an example/target tenant is needed, use the designated **Paige Operator Workspace** (§200 `platform_operator_tenant_id`), a fresh `test-tenant-*` row, or a placeholder. **A surgical repo-wide audit (docs + code comments + fixtures) found ZERO example-misuse to scrub** — every existing real-account reference is legitimate (real §13 corrections/decision-log/audit entries, real master-tenant gate LOGIC + migration names + data-fix migrations, real portfolio/architecture documentation, or meta-prohibition surfaces like the platform-independence sweep regex that must NAME the marks to enforce the ban). Two shipped-UI-copy hits (`BusinessCreditAdmin.tsx:49` "monitored MMA contacts", `ClientJourney.tsx` legal-posture copy) flagged as a SEPARATE §200 platform-independence concern (real account name in shipped copy — NOT example-tenant misuse), tracked as a follow-up, not scrubbed here (may be legitimate white-label copy). §-number is provisional (owner picks the final number, same PROPOSED pattern as §57–§62).

(Owner destroyed a wrong auto-generated `paige-agent-ai` Fly app + closed PR #489 before the correct deploy.) **This PR redeploys `skill-runner`** (a real activation comment on `browseViaHost` triggers `deploy-edge-functions.yml`) so it reads the new edge secrets — the `browse` seam transitions `needs_config` → **live calling the Fly host** on the next self-verify skill run. **Slice 2 (#143) is UNBLOCKED** — seed the first self-verify skill (`autonomy_lane:"auto"`+`risk_level:"read_only"` so the read-only browse fires; §16 gate) + the Fork-8 reasoning prompt (Paige judges what she saw vs intent, not literal echo). **§32.c FIRST FULL-LOOP:** Cowork fires paige-mcp `run_skill` the moment Slice 2 lands — drives the self-verify skill end-to-end, confirms the browser actually navigates, reports the live-drive result to the owner (ends the owner-owed-walk pattern this whole wave exists to kill).

- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 Slice 1b SHIPPED — the interpreter's FIRST real tool-dispatch seam (browser).** The skill interpreter had ZERO tool-dispatch (`allowed_tools` was declarative-only, never executed — per §30 scout). Slice 1b (owner Fork 3) wires a `browser` dispatch that calls the Slice-1a `services/paige-browser` Fly host through the §16 clamp. **§18 clean:** injected a `deps.browse` seam into `InterpretDeps` MIRRORING `deps.forge` — the interpreter CORE stays pure + unit-testable; the actual outbound `fetch` lives in the HOST (`skill-runner` `browseViaHost` → `POST {PAIGE_BROWSER_URL}/self-verify`, `X-Browser-Secret:{PAIGE_BROWSER_SECRET}`, env NAMES only §34, honest `needs_config` when unset §13). **The dispatch block** (skill-interpreter.ts, between context-gather and `buildForgeIntent`): detects a `browser` step, **GATES on `allowed_tools.includes("browser")` — allowed_tools is now EXECUTED for the first time** (the owner's "reads allowed_tools for real"), consults the **§16 risk floor BEFORE navigating** (read_only+auto executes; `mutating`/`external_send` can NEVER run a browse under auto — forced approval via `resolveExecutionMode`, reused not forked), writes the `browser_use_sessions` ledger (`invoker_kind:"skill"`, insert `running`→update `succeeded`/`failed`, §9 scope via `related_contact_id` — there is NO `tenant_id` column), and folds the HONEST observation into `contextText` for the forge (never fabricated; honest `needs_config`/failed paths return before forge). **§32 PROVEN TO RUN (real, verified by CC):** a Deno smoke drives the ACTUAL `interpretSkill` (mock browse+forge, chainable mock admin) — 18/18 assertions incl. (a) browse called with the step url, (b) observation folded into the forge intent, (c) ledger insert+update with `invoker_kind:"skill"`, (d) `needs_config`→honest degrade before forge, (e) write-class risk gated (no browse, no ledger row, run lands approval); vitest 7/7 on the pure decision helpers. `deno check` on the 3 edited edge files = 6 errors IDENTICAL to pre-edit baseline (all upstream `model-router`/`prompt-forge`/`skill-runner:315`) → **ZERO new type errors**. **§1 crew: build + adversarial §39 verifier (SHIP, tier/§16/§9/§37 all hold) + compliance (SHIP).** Applied 2 non-blocking peer-gate fixes (screenshot b64 stored ONCE not twice; precise `invoker_kind` comment) + gitignored the `deno.lock` deno-check artifact. **SCOPE: the SEAM ONLY** — NO production self-verify skill seeded (that is Slice 2 — which must seed `autonomy_lane:"auto"`+`risk_level:"read_only"` so the read-only browse actually fires), NO write-class browser steps (paige-browser rejects them), NO deploy. **§32.c live end-to-end drive against a DEPLOYED paige-browser (PAIGE_BROWSER_URL/_SECRET set) OWED to the next capable session** — this headless session proved the seam vs a mock of the exact contract, not the live Fly service. §50 clean (0 hits, 5 files).

NOT a scope bug (§588 already fixed), NOT a tier-feature gate, NOT an autonomy clamp. **FIX:** added inline `update_business_profile` to paige-ai-chat (§18 chat-surface TWIN of `update_tenant_branding` — SAME home: `tenants.name` + `tenants.brand` jsonb shallow-merged, no new table, no paige-mcp call-out), accepting company-detail keys (website/address/phone/legal_entity_name + existing brand keys); MUTATING_TOOLS confirm-gate (§16); admin/coach-gated; **tenant server-resolved from `personaCtx.tenant_id`, NEVER a tool arg (§9/§51 — sub-account writes ITS OWN tenant, God tenant-less degrades honestly)**; extended `_shared/brand-tokens.ts` + `buildBrandSection` to READ the new keys so the write→read loop closes (§13, not write-only); new BUSINESS PROFILE prompt block makes Paige DRIVE setup draft-first, never punt (§36/§7/§15). **§1 crew: build + adversarial/§51-tier verifier (tier matrix clean, no IDOR) + compliance (SHIP — real capability, not prompt-only).** §39 peer-gate CAUGHT a real bug the build missed: the audit insert used non-existent columns (`resource_type/resource_id/metadata`) — FIXED to the real schema (`entity/entity_id/data`) with a non-swallowed error log. **That peer-gate also surfaced a PRE-EXISTING latent bug** (crm_pipeline_change + crm_assign_coach audit inserts have the same wrong columns, silently failing) → scoped out to task #141. §2/§3/§11/§50 clean. **§32 TYPE-VERIFIED (real, not assumed):** installed Deno 2.1.4 in-session and ran `deno check` on all 3 edited files — the two `_shared` files are CLEAN (0 errors); `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` reports 14 errors that are BYTE-IDENTICAL in count to pristine `origin/main` (the pre-existing `logAnalyticsEvent`/SupabaseClient generic-mismatch baseline) → **my edits introduced ZERO new type errors.** IMPORTANT §13 correction to the CI picture: **`ci.yml`'s `verify` job does NOT type-check Deno edge functions** (`ci:tsc`/`build`/`test` are frontend-only; changed-file gates match `^src/**` only) — so a green `verify` would NOT have covered these edits; the in-session `deno check` is the real gate here, not CI. **§32.c runtime drive still OWED to Cowork's paige-mcp** (headless session can't drive the authed chat): drive "set up my business profile" per tier, confirm intake+write, no deflection. NON-blocker on this PR: the Supabase Preview `relation "profiles" already exists` failure is the pre-existing #275 migration-replay conflict (this PR adds NO migration).

Cloned from the proven `services/visual-renderer` recipe. `POST /self-verify {url,…}` drives a URL headless → HONEST structured observation `{ ok, final_url, http_status, title, text_excerpt, screenshot_b64, steps, duration_ms }` (never a 5xx on nav/timeout/block; failure returns `ok:false` + visible-fallback screenshot + loud log). SSRF guard reused VERBATIM from visual-renderer (Fork 7, owner-signed-off): DNS-resolving fail-closed `hostIsPrivate` + `page.route("**/*")` on nav AND sub-resource + `final_url` re-checked public after redirects. Shared-secret timing-safe gate; unset secret fails closed (500). **DB-FREE by construction (§9/§34)** — no Supabase creds, no rows; ledger + tenant-scope live in the Slice 1b caller. Read-only steps only (`assertSelector`/`assertText`/`readText`); any click/submit/type/download REJECTED with an honest error (gated behind the §16 clamp later). Concurrency soft cap + nav/hard-cap/step timeouts (Fork 5 v1). §18: NEW home, distinct from visual-renderer (stateless screenshot) AND browser-use (Browserbase stub); SAME pinned playwright version (no third install). **§32 PROVEN TO RUN** — `smoke.mjs` green against real Chromium (exit 0; honest present→ok:true / missing→ok:false, no throw). §1 crew (build + adversarial verifier + compliance officer) — BOTH reviews SHIP, 0 blockers; applied 2 peer-gate hardening fixes (context null-guard vs setup-failure leak; bounded per-step/`evaluate` timeouts). **KNOWN ACCEPTED RESIDUAL (§13, task #138):** SSRF DNS-rebinding TOCTOU inherited verbatim from visual-renderer — NOT weakened here; to be hardened ONCE across BOTH browser services (never silent). **DORMANT until deployed to Fly + `PAIGE_BROWSER_SHARED_SECRET` set** — no live-app behavior change on merge. Scope: self-verify only, NO tenant auth (Slice 4), NO interpreter dispatch (Slice 1b — NEXT). §50 trademark-clean (0 hits). **CodeQL caught 4 high alerts the crew's verifier missed (a different tool — §39 layers, none alone sufficient):** 3× "externally-controlled format string" (user `url` in a `console.error` format-string position + 2nd arg) — FIXED (static literal format string, `url` as trailing arg); 1× `js/missing-rate-limiting` on `/self-verify` — added a REAL hand-rolled fixed-window per-IP limiter, but CodeQL's query only recognizes NAMED middleware (express-rate-limit) so alert #73 persists as a recognition-limitation (substance addressed; non-blocking — `mergeable_state=unstable`, only `verify` is required). Accepted residual folded to task #138 (adopt express-rate-limit across BOTH browser services, or dismiss with justification — owner-visible §14 dep decision).

- **2026-08-12 · Task #126 (Paige web-browser install) — §30 SUBSTRATE SCOUT findings, filed BEFORE architecture (hard §30 gate):** A read-only Explore scout swept 7 questions across the repo. **Headline: a browser home ALREADY EXISTS; the real decision is extend/activate-vs-rebuild, NOT build-from-scratch.** Three distinct browser seams, all Playwright+Chromium (never Puppeteer/browserless): **(A) `services/visual-renderer/`** — the §33 Fly service that launches a REAL warm headless Chromium (`server.js:81-90`, base image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.48.0-jammy`), but shaped as a STATELESS screenshotter (`/render`, `/render-html`), shared-secret gated, with the repo's STRONGEST SSRF guard (DNS-resolving `page.route` interceptor, fail-closed `hostIsPrivate`). Production-wired but **dormant** — gated off by absence of `VISUAL_RENDERER_URL`/`_SECRET` (no `_ENABLED` flag); its own header says do NOT fork it into a stateful agent. **(B) `scripts/live-drive/live-drive.mjs`** — the §32 helper that ACTUALLY drives an authed page headless (launch→navigate→form-login→steps/asserts→screenshot→honest `{ok}`); ships reusable primitives already solved: `resolvePlaywright`, `resolveExecutablePath` (scans `/opt/pw-browsers`), `buildLaunchOptions` (wires `HTTPS_PROXY`→`proxy` only when set), `defaultFormLogin`, `scrubSensitiveInputs`/`redactSecrets`. **Dev/CI-only, not deployed** — and honest caveat: prod `paigeagent.ai` was NOT reachable headless from the CI sandbox even via proxy. **(C) `supabase/functions/browser-use/index.ts`** — a Browserbase agent **WIRED but INERT** (returns `unavailable` until `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`+`BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` set); even when configured it only opens a Browserbase session + logs a replay URL — its own comment (`:58-60`) states *"Real Playwright control would happen here… Edge functions can't import Playwright."* Backed by an EXISTING **`browser_use_sessions`** ledger table (`goal/start_url/steps/result/screenshots[]/status/cost_cents/duration_ms/invoker_kind`, RLS: admins/owner all, coaches own-clients). **Web-fetch layer (COMPLEMENTARY, not subsumed):** `paige-deep-research` (bounded PLAN→SEARCH→READ→GAP-CHECK cited engine, anti-fabrication gate) consumes `paige-web-search` (Firecrawl) + `fetch-url-content` (SSRF-guarded raw fetch, NOT a browser); a duplicate `web-search` (admin-gated Firecrawl) also exists (Tavily deprecated §88). A browser ADDS what these can't: JS-rendered pages, click/submit/download, and **authenticated** surfaces. **Two critical GAPS a plan must not miss: (1) the skill interpreter has ZERO tool-dispatch** — `CONTEXT_TOOLS = {context,rag,client_memory}` + `pdf_render` are the only recognized tools; `allowed_tools` (incl. `firecrawl`/`browser`/`scrape` seeded on many S2 skills) is **declarative-only, never executed** — a browser tool needs a brand-new dispatch seam wired THROUGH the §16 clamp (`resolveExecutionMode`'s risk floor forces `approval` for `mutating`/`external_send`). **(2) No live browser runs ANYWHERE today** — visual-renderer dormant, `browser-use` a Browserbase stub, CI can't reach prod headless. Everything is scaffolding. **§9:** auth is Supabase JWT throughout; tenant scope is server-resolved (`assertTenantScope` throws §9 without `tenantId`); a browser drive must carry server-resolved tenant scope + a scoped **test-tenant** credential (live-drive README already mandates this, never owner PII). **§18 version debt:** `playwright` pinned TWICE already (root devDep `1.56.1` vs Fly service `1.48.0`) — a third install must pick ONE home. **Master §4 consistency (NOT a §13 correction):** §4 already lists **Browserbase + Firecrawl** as integrations (lines 200/270) — `browser-use` existing is consistent; the only nuance to record is that it is wired-but-inert and edge-Playwright-blocked. Full scout output archived in-session (agent a8112a5e02ea6dc9b). **NEXT: 8 architecture forks surfaced to owner for ruling (below in chat) — NO build until owner rules (kickoff hard rule).**

The integrator SCRUBBED every backend name from name/description/methodology_anchor/steps into plain language, added a hard §11 assertion (Python) + a SQL `v_jargon=0` proof gate, and kept the seam→skill mapping ONLY in the migration header comment (not tenant-visible).

Also folded: `is_platform_default` from `scoping` (engages the §2 finance guard), honest run-status mapping (denied/needs_config → `cancelled`, needs_input → `awaiting_confirm`, so success_count isn't inflated), and keeping `force_interpreter` out of the MCP schema. This is exactly the §1/§39 failure mode the crew exists to prevent — a green headless build that was subtly broken against real constraints.

"Reuse the enum" was impossible. **(2) `paige_skills.steps`/`allowed_tools` are PURELY DESCRIPTIVE** — the runner ignores them and dispatches via a hardcoded `switch(slug)` with 4 bespoke handlers, so "generalize the switch to read steps" is NOT a refactor but a NEW steps-interpreter, putting §58 byte-identical at real risk (owner ruled: build the full interpreter anyway; CC deferred it to a fresh session per §5 rather than rush the engine at a saturated session-end). **(3) the §61 three-state ruling does NOT fit the binary `Set<Feature>`** — "agency=resell" can't be a set-membership bit; owner ruled `skills`=self-use Feature (god/solo/sub/enterprise) + resell=Marketplace concept. All three logged so the next S1 session doesn't re-derive them.

Docs-only doctrine PR (#463); the S1 build + 3 Tashia-live-drive gap fixes follow as separate PRs.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork miss #12 (log):** Cowork asked CC to ask the owner which tiers get the §60 `skills` feature-key when the answer was implicit in a standing owner-pattern stated multiple times across sessions (God has everything · Solo + Sub-account default · Agency resells · Enterprise hybrid). Owner correction verbatim: *"This is yet another time that you guys have asked me something around the idea of where things should be placed when we should actually already have this understanding for the entire platform."* **Lesson:** recurring owner rulings across sessions ARE doctrine even before formal capture — Cowork's job is to codify the pattern on the SECOND occurrence, not the fifth. §61 Standing Tier Distribution Default drafted PROPOSED to close this loop permanently. Same class as Cowork miss #11 (ruling-conversion discipline). Filed as a §BRAIN.3 standing-pattern-codification lesson.
- **2026-08-11 · Owner-premise correction — "contact-lookup 500" was TWO defects, not one (§30/§13, #127):** the owner live-drive reported Paige returning "no contact named Tashia Anderson on file" AND a "non-2xx" error, framed as one contact-lookup failure. **CC §30 diagnosis DISPROVED the single-cause premise:** (a) the false-negative was a **search tokenization bug** — the CRM filter matched the whole phrase `"Tashia Anderson"` against each single column, so a real row with first_name/last_name in SEPARATE columns matched 0 rows (never a 500 on the lookup itself); (b) the "non-2xx" came from an **unrelated nested tool** (content-draft/generate-image), NOT contact-lookup. Two symptoms, two causes, conflated because Paige narrated both as "no record." Fixed in PR #462: tokenized search (`_shared/contact-search.ts`, §18 one home, wired into all 3 lookup tools) + a LOOKUP HONESTY prompt rule (found / found-nothing / could-not-check never collapse). **New standing lesson filed** to `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` §0c: *a tool error is NOT proof the record is absent* — an empty query means "matched nothing," an errored tool means "couldn't check," neither means "does not exist." §32.b proven on prod; §32.c owner live-drive owed.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork miss #11:** Owner ruled D7 clearly (Option A direct C-Corp conversion, no holdco, Paige Agent AI Inc. standalone). CC's §37 producer inventory correctly surfaced adjacent stale doctrine (Portfolio-mode C-suite architecture + CoreConnect/Disputera refs). Instead of converting the existing ruling into complete execution guidance, Cowork re-presented it to the owner as "Reading 1 vs Reading 2" options. Owner correction verbatim: *"There's no need to keep going back and forth with me on what the structure is now… Don't go back and forth with me on anything related to anything else. We need to delete it and update it. That's it."* **Lesson:** when the owner has ruled, Cowork's job is to convert the ruling into COMPLETE execution guidance covering the full scope §37 surfaces — NOT to re-open the ruling as options. Stale doctrine that contradicts an owner ruling is dead by implication; §28 protects CURRENT approved designs, not superseded ones. Portfolio-as-corporate-structure is dead; Portfolio-as-marketplace-feature is a distinct future scope (task #129).
- **2026-08-11 · Doctrine correction — corporate structure (D7, owner-FINAL: DELETE):** `docs/doctrine/paige-c-suite-roster.md` (authored 2026-07-27) recorded the company (then Paige Agent AI **LLC**) as a **wholly-owned subsidiary of CoreConnect Technologies, Inc.** (a Wyoming holdco) and built a THREE-scope C-suite (tenant · operator · **portfolio/parent-entity**) on that premise. **Owner ruled 2026-08-11: that structure is DEAD — Paige Agent AI Inc. is a STANDALONE Delaware C-Corp (direct conversion from the LLC, Option A), no holdco, no parent.** Owner FINAL ruling (amending an earlier CC "flag-for-review" hedge): **DELETE the stale doctrine, don't preserve it** — *"There's no need to keep going back and forth… delete it and update it."* Executed: the holdco/subsidiary block + the entire "Portfolio / parent-entity" C-suite scope are **DELETED**; the C-suite is now **TWO scopes (tenant + operator)**. §28 protects CURRENT approved designs, NOT superseded doctrine. New living doctrine authored: `docs/doctrine/paige-corporate-structure.md`. **"Portfolio" is retired as a corporate-structure term** — going forward it means ONE thing: a future *marketplace feature* (task #129). **A SEPARATE, larger structure surfaced during the sweep (§13 flag):** `docs/portfolio/PORTFOLIO_SCOPE_BRIEFING.md` + the public Footer document a **Givalli Heritage Holdings Inc. parent / Aedis Brands LLC IP-licensing / 9-subsidiary** structure (bigger than CoreConnect). The briefing is marked **SUPERSEDED** for Paige; the Footer's Aedis/Givalli brand-license line was PRESERVED (a standalone C-Corp *can* license IP) and **flagged for owner** (task #128) — not part of the CoreConnect ruling, owner confirms whether it survives.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork miss #10 (re-anchor, D7):** the skills-wave paste framed D7 as a straight "LLC → Inc." find-replace on owner shorthand. CC's §30 caught two problems before executing: (a) Cowork cited a doctrine doc (`paige-corporate-structure-2026-08-01.md`) that **did not exist**; (b) the live doctrine (`paige-c-suite-roster.md:82-88`) carried a **contradictory holdco/subsidiary structure**. Owner ruling: **Option A · direct C-Corp conversion** (no holdco, standalone Paige Agent AI Inc.). **Lesson (both CC + Cowork):** never cite a doctrine doc without verifying it exists (§BRAIN.2); a bare "rename X→Y" over a legal-entity identity is never a blind find-replace — it splits into present-tense identity (swept), vendor-account records (annotated pending-rename, §13 — the Twilio Org is *still literally named LLC* until the owner renames it), immutable applied legal-template migrations (flagged owner-owed, never edited), and dated historical docs (kept as honest history).
- **2026-08-11 · §60 Enterprise HYBRID baseline SHIPPED — closes flag 1 from PR #458 (Skills Wave Slice 0):** owner ruled (mid-handoff 2026-08-11) that **Enterprise is the ONE HYBRID tier** — it inherits BOTH the Solo/Sub-account "doing" surface (CRM + creation + `customer_portal_invite`) AND the Agency "managing" surface (`subaccount_management`). `ENTERPRISE_FEATURES` is now `new Set([...SOLO_FEATURES, ...AGENCY_FEATURES, ...CREATION_SURFACES])` — net change vs prior baseline: **enterprise GAINS `customer_portal_invite`** (it previously had creation but not portal-invite — the exact internal inconsistency flag 1 named: creation-capable yet unable to invite the clients those campaigns are for). **Both layers moved in ONE PR (§37 no split-brain):** the UI helper (`tierFeatures.ts`) AND the server RPC — new migration `20260824000000` narrows `create_tenant_invite_token`'s consumer guard from `IN ('agency','enterprise')` → `= 'agency'` (byte-faithful superset of `20260823000000`; #227 subaccount_owner + FIX-1 owner-role gates preserved verbatim). **§32.a PROVEN on prod** (BEGIN…ROLLBACK as super_admin, temp tenants: `enterprise_consumer=SUCCESS`, `solo_consumer=SUCCESS`, `agency_consumer=BLOCKED(42501)`, `agency_team=SUCCESS`). **§37/§57:** all 5 consumer-invite minters route through `hasTierFeature('customer_portal_invite')` (no hardcode; `lint:tier-features` clean 896 files) → UI auto-updates for enterprise, server allows it, no producer breaks (loosening cannot 4xx a prior-passing caller). **§58:** no tier loses anything — only enterprise gains. §39 peer-gate (headless self-administered, stated per §13): no blocking findings. tsc 0 · vitest 18/18 · lint:tier-features clean. A pure AGENCY is still blocked on both layers (the §60 lock holds for agency). **Flag 2 (`god` tierKey collapses super_admin+platform_admin) remains open** — deferred (YAGNI until a super_admin-only *client* feature exists; server already enforces the real §53 boundary).
- **2026-08-11 · §60 tier-lock SERVER ENFORCEMENT + Growth/Studio tier move SHIPPED (task #125):** completes the §60 lock end-to-end. (1) **Server half of the `customer_portal_invite` lock** — new migration `20260823000000` adds an `account_type` guard to `create_tenant_invite_token`: a `_kind='consumer'` mint for an agency/enterprise TARGET tenant now RAISEs 42501, for ALL callers (incl. platform owner). Faithful superset of the live #227 F.1 body (byte-diff = exactly the 11-line guard; auth gate / subaccount_owner / owner-role / contact checks all preserved; grants untouched). **§32.a PROVEN on prod** (BEGIN…ROLLBACK as super_admin: consumer+agency BLOCKED, consumer+sub ALLOWED, team+agency ALLOWED). (2) **`growth` + new `studio` feature** = solo/sub/enterprise/god — NOT agency (owner ruling: an agency manages sub-accounts, not its own campaign/creative book); god GAINS them (§35 dogfooding). Enterprise kept growth (no regression) + gained studio as an explicit superset. (3) **`RequireFeature` route gate** (§18 one home, mirrors `FundingRoute`) on `/admin/campaigns` + `/admin/studio` — the lock is REAL, not nav-only (§13); guards on `loading` to avoid a fail-open flash. §1 crew: build + §39 peer-gate (SHIP, migration byte-faithful) + §5 compliance (SHIP after docs reconcile + loading-guard). tsc 0 · lint:tier-features clean (895 files) · vitest 18/18. **Two owner-flags for #124:** Enterprise gets creation but NOT `customer_portal_invite` (inconsistent — recommend giving it) **[UPDATE 2026-08-11: flag 1 CLOSED — owner ruled Enterprise HYBRID; enterprise now gets `customer_portal_invite` on BOTH layers, migration `20260824000000`. See the Enterprise-HYBRID entry above.]**; the `god` tierKey collapses super_admin + platform_admin (fine for dogfooding, blocks a future super_admin-only god feature) **[flag 2 still open]**. Owner §32.c owed (agency can't reach Studio/portal-invite; god/solo/sub can).
- **2026-08-11 · §13 correction #8 (hypothetical-Enterprise deferral REVERSED by owner):** during #122 CC/Cowork framed the server-side consumer-invite gate as blocking on an Enterprise ruling — to avoid "breaking a legitimate agency-with-direct-clients or Enterprise-with-custom-permissions." **Owner correction: there are ZERO Enterprise customers yet (pre-MVP), so there was zero real risk to protect against** — the deferral was rooted in a customer scenario that doesn't exist. Server gate shipped now (#125). **Standing rule (both CC + Cowork):** before invoking "customer risk" to defer a change, VERIFY the customer class exists in current state (query the `tenants` table / master §4 SHIPPED / brain) — hypothetical-customer risk is not real risk when the class has zero members. Real classes today: Solo + Sub-account + Agency + Super-Admin operator. Enterprise = 0. (Filed to `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` as a standing bar.)
- **2026-08-11 · getTierFeatureSet structural tier-lock SHIPPED + §60 doctrine (task #122, owner-MANDATORY):** the §60 ONE HOME for tier→feature mapping is live — `src/lib/tier/tierFeatures.ts` (`TIER_FEATURE_BASELINE` + `resolveTierKey`/`getTierFeatureSet`/`hasFeature`) + `useTierFeatures()` hook + `lint:tier-features` CI guard (sibling of `lint:views`/`lint:definer-fns`) + a matrix unit test. Owner-locked baseline: **`customer_portal_invite` = Solo + Sub-account ONLY** (Agency + Super Admin excluded). The §1 review crew on the real diff caught what the build missed: **§39 BLOCKER — a 5th ungated consumer-portal minter** (`WorkspaceSettingsPanel`, on the UNIVERSAL Setup surface) — now gated, so all 5 minters honor the lock; plus §25/§5 UI-consistency fixes (blank-Select reset, dead Resend button) and §18 refactors (shared `canOwnSubaccounts()`). **§13 HONESTY:** the lock is enforced at the **UI/build-time** layer (helper + lint across all 5 minters); the server RPC `create_tenant_invite_token` does NOT yet tier-gate `_kind='consumer'` (NOT a §9 IDOR — an agency mints only under its own tenant_id) — the server-side gate is a tracked follow-up tied to the open owner-decision on Agency's client book. **[UPDATE #125, 2026-08-11: that follow-up is CLOSED — the server gate landed in migration `20260823000000`, §32.a-proven; `customer_portal_invite` is now server-enforced, no longer UI-only. See the #125 entry above.]** Verified: tsc 0 · lint:tier-features clean · vitest 16/16. §60 doctrine added to `CLAUDE.md` (PROPOSED).
- **2026-08-11 · §13 correction #7 (deferral REVERSED by owner):** after CC's #121 §30 audit found ZERO current tier feature-gate leaks, Cowork/CC recommended DEFERRING the `getTierFeatureSet()` helper on §18 grounds ("scaffolding a solution to a non-existent problem"). **Owner explicitly overruled: build the helper as MANDATORY structural enforcement** — precisely because features/skills/designs drift silently and get mis-quoted at every level, and text-only doctrine relies on memory. The absence of leaks TODAY isn't the point; the point is structurally locking tier-baseline so future features CAN'T drift. Reversed by the helper PR (task #122). **Lesson:** "no bug to encode" is NOT sufficient to defer a structural anti-recurrence primitive when the owner has repeatedly named the drift class as friction; an owner ruling re-stated across sessions is the signal to STRUCTURALLY LOCK it, not to await the next specific violation.
- **2026-08-11 · MMA sub-account slug mismatch fixed (owner live-drive, §30/§32.a data-fix, task #123):** the owner's Agency-dashboard live-drive caught the sub-account **Mogul Maker Academy** (`d8a0a880`) rendering at `/mr-mogul-maker-academy`. §30 DISPROVED the handoff's "one free-slug rename" premise: the target `mogul-maker-academy` was already held by the **PARENT agency** "Project Mogul Enterprise Inc" (`29a7c77f`) under the UNIQUE `tenants_slug_key` — the two slugs were mismatched, a residue of the Academy→Agency tier reversal (#55) where the slug never followed the rename (the tenant that BECAME the parent agency kept the academy slug; the real academy sub-account got a dedup-prefixed `mr-`). The parent agency's own slug was therefore also wrong (an agency named "Project Mogul Enterprise Inc" resolving at `/mogul-maker-academy`). Owner ruled **Full swap**: parent → `project-mogul-enterprise`, child → `mogul-maker-academy` (one transaction, parent freed first to satisfy the UNIQUE constraint). **§32.a proven on prod:** rollback-proof GREEN → committed → post-apply query confirms both rows + **0 `mr-` prefixes remaining + 0 duplicate slugs** platform-wide; §51 invariant intact (child stays `sub_account`, parent stays top-level `agency`). **§37:** slug is a live public-route key (`/store/:slug`, growth page/funnel renderers, `peek_tenant_portal_brand`) — parent's 1 + child's 4 growth pages change public URL prefix (pre-launch, no known external traffic); **NO live code/DB object keys on either slug string** (the historical `mogul-maker-academy` migration refs are immutable already-applied one-time DML, not live objects). Data-only fix via MCP (no migration file — hardcoded tenant IDs, per the apply-migration guidance). Owner §32.c live-drive owed (Agency dashboard shows `/mogul-maker-academy`). **Root-cause note (not fixed platform-wide per owner directive):** the `mr-` prefix likely traces to slug generation seeding from the owner handle (`mrmogulmaker`) during dedup; §39 confirmed **no other tenant** carries an `mr-` prefix, so no broader slug-generation sweep was opened.
- **2026-08-11 · #121 MMA §16-block "stale classification" hypothesis DISPROVED (§30/§13):** the handoff hypothesized MMA rendered the §16 department block (while sibling PME sub-accounts did not) because of stale historical Solo classification / a hardcoded tenant gate. CC's §30 audit disproved it: all four PME tenants are confirmed `sub_account`; the block is NOT keyed on tenant_id/`account_type`/`features`/tier at all. The real discriminator was `emptyBook` (book data-state) — the block was nested inside the non-empty branch of `PracticeOverview.tsx`'s empty-state conditional, so MMA (2 clients) showed it and 0-client siblings got the blank-canvas EmptyState. Fixed by hoisting the block above the split (PR #453), same class as task #99's Systems Check tile. The platform-wide sweep found ZERO other feature-gate leaks. (The owner subsequently ruled the `getTierFeatureSet()` structural-enforcement helper MANDATORY regardless — see correction #7, filed with the helper PR.)
- **2026-08-11 · Owner-locked doctrine ratification: §57 · §58 · §59.** §57 (Super Admin = source of truth) · §58 (Anti-regression rule) · §59 (SECURITY DEFINER caller-scope-in-body). All three drafted PROPOSED overnight in the #449 close-out; ratified explicitly by the owner the morning of 2026-08-11. **Binding on every future PR.** §58 adds a standing §39-verifier checklist item — *"Did this PR silently remove any previously-shipped capability?"* — starting immediately on the next PR. §59's enforcement (`lint:definer-fns` CI guard + `pg_proc` drift advisor) is already live from #117 (PR #448).
- **2026-08-11 · #117 SECURITY DEFINER function class (companion to #116):** #116 (PR #447) closed the VIEW anon-reach class (`security_invoker=off` view drift); **#117 (PR #448) closed the FUNCTION anon-reach class (SECURITY DEFINER owner-bypass).** Same underlying mechanism (owner-scoped execution bypassing RLS), different Postgres object types. The full anon/cross-tenant-reach class is now closed at BOTH object types AND the CI-guard layer (`lint:views` + `lint:definer-fns`). **Honest severity (§13):** #117's 20 leaks are authenticated-only (lower blast radius than #116's anon-reachable PII/FICO); 1 HIGH (the `delete_credit_report_upload` auth bypass — role-checked a caller-supplied identity param instead of `auth.uid()`).
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork #55 root-cause naming WRONG (CC-corrected via #116):** Cowork originally named the Command Center approvals leak a "permissive-OR bypass." **Real cause = `security_invoker=off` VIEW drift on `paige_approval_queue_v`** (the view ran as owner and bypassed RLS). Corrected/fixed in #116 (PR #447, the 11-view sweep) — do not cite the "permissive-OR" framing.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork out-of-band commit during #55 §32.a validation (§13 honesty flag):** during the #55 §32.a validation Cowork committed instead of rolling back a validation change. Idempotent, no harm done — flagged here per §13 for the record.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork Task #22 Twilio framing WRONG:** Cowork framed task #22 as "owner needs to paste the Twilio SID." **Setup is DONE** (secrets set, operator comms live per Section 4); the real blocker is **A2P carrier approval** (owner resubmitted, awaiting carrier). #22 is correctly stated as "awaiting A2P carrier approval," NOT "owner needs to paste SID."
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork memory-drift class (standing correction):** Cowork asked the owner about already-handled items (the Twilio setup being the anchor case — asking for a paste that was already done). **Standing correction:** read the queue + prior rulings (and the brain, §BRAIN.2) BEFORE asking the owner — do not re-surface settled/handled items as open questions.
- **2026-08-11 · Cowork "brain doesn't exist on main" WRONG (stale-checkout class):** Cowork claimed `docs/brain/` doesn't exist on main. **Reality:** it is partially live via #443/#445 (at minimum `decision-log.md`). Cowork was reading a stale checkout. Same class as misses #10/#11 — bind to `ref: main` (Section 4 discipline block).
- **2026-08-11 · #444 hotfix-bundle premise corrections (§30, CC-caught pre-code, tasks #40/#41/#42/PR #444):** three §32.b bugs from the owner's MMA live-drive; §30 corrected all three handoff-stated causes. (D1) "Preview unavailable" was NOT a `meta`-vs-`body` reader mismatch — `loadDocument` already reads `body`; the real cause was the streamed `paige_artifact` frame omitting `tenant_id`, so the card read under the VIEWER's active tenant, not the doc's owning (managed sub-account) tenant. (D2) People-tab KPI-2/list-0 was NOT a SQL over-filter — it's the client-side "My Queue" view (`scopeMine`) hiding contacts assigned to another user while the KPI counted the full array. (D3) the fresh sub-account's empty Systems Check was NOT a standalone-vs-subaccount trigger divergence — NO creation path fired an onboarding scan on ANY tier (the `systems-check-run-onboarding` runner was orphaned; every prior run is daily-cron), and the fix required a migration (the handoff assumed none). Also: the handoff named `tenant-signup` as the standalone provisioning home, but that edge fn only mints the auth user — real tenant creation is `provision_tenant`/`provision_tenant_as`, covered by an AFTER INSERT trigger. All §32.a-proven on prod (`20260818000000` persisted; helper + trigger live; `create_subaccount` enqueue present).
- **2026-08-10 · #109 Lovable/Gemini chat-premise correction (§30, CC-caught pre-code, task #109/PR #442):** the #109 handoff premise was that the Paige chat runs on the **Lovable AI gateway** serving `google/gemini-2.5-*`, and the deliverable was to "swap it to direct Gemini." **CC's §30 diagnosis (proven with live `paige_llm_trace`) reversed this: the chat is ALREADY direct-Anthropic AND has no Gemini or Lovable in the runtime.** `_shared/claude.ts` `gatewayCompat` is a direct-Anthropic shim (`ANTHROPIC_URL`, `callClaude` / `streamAnthropicAsOpenAI`) — it IGNORES the `Bearer ${lovableApiKey}` header, and the `"google/gemini-2.5-flash"/"-pro"` strings are **legacy labels** `tierForLegacyModel` maps to Claude tiers (flash→haiku/classification, pro→sonnet/reasoning). Prod trace: `claude-haiku-4-5` + `claude-sonnet-5` + `featherless`, zero lovable/gemini. So "is the chat on Lovable/Gemini?" = **NO, it's Anthropic** — do not re-diagnose. What #442 actually shipped: the **#34 approval-loop fix** (a `substantiveTurn` heuristic routes approval/creation turns to the reasoning=Sonnet tier so `document_generate` fires instead of looping) + the **safe Lovable purge** (deleted the one live `api.lovable.app` caller `parse-business-credit-report` + 16 vestigial dead-code refs). The **live Lovable email trinity** (`auth-email-hook`+`process-email-queue`+`handle-email-suppression`, `@lovable.dev` HMAC+delivery SDKs) could NOT be atomically removed — it's launch-critical (silently 401s signup if ripped out) — and is sequenced as **task #112** (owner secrets + §32 live-email verify).
- **2026-08-10 · Systems Check availability-by-accident (owner-reported, CC-fixed, task #99) + new §56 doctrine:** the owner reported the tenant Systems Check was missing on several **sub-accounts** while showing on Mogul Maker Academy, and hypothesized a tier-misclassification ("thinking it's a solo account"). CC's §30 diagnostic found the real cause was NOT tier classification: the `<SystemsCheckTile scope="tenant" />` was gated INSIDE the non-empty branch of `PracticeOverview.tsx`'s `{emptyBook ? … : …}` conditional (`emptyBook` = 0 clients + 0 attention + 0 approvals), so every freshly-provisioned tenant — solo OR sub-account — rendered only the "blank canvas" empty state and never saw the check; Academy has clients (`emptyBook=false`) so it showed. Routing is tier-uniform (all tenant-selected staff → `PracticeOverview`, Admin.tsx:892), so the fix is availability, not routing. **Fix (PR pending, branch `claude/systems-check-tier-availability`):** render the tenant tile ABOVE the empty/non-empty split on `PracticeOverview` (covers solo + all sub-accounts, empty book or not) AND add it to `AgencyBoard` (`/agency`, the agency owner's DEFAULT landing — its own-business check, scoped to the agency's own tenant), matching the operator tile already on `OperatorCommandCenter`. Systems Check is now uniform across **God · Agency · Standalone/solo · Sub-account** — the owner's "repeatable throughout the entire process." Crew: design-engineer + §39 adversarial (SHIP) + §5 compliance (ITERATE→the AgencyBoard gap, now closed). **New doctrine `CLAUDE.md §56`** (lands §51's forward-referenced "platform impact assessment"): before ANY build, check `docs/doctrine/tier-matrix.md` to name which account type(s) the feature is for AND decide per-tier whether it belongs — a capability meant for "every tier" must render regardless of empty-book/branch/route accident. Propagated to §56, `tier-matrix.md`, this log, and `docs/brain/` in the same PR.

CC's fresh-clone check on main: file does NOT exist at that path — real conversation components live under `src/pages/admin/conversations/`. Cowork's Grep hit was a stale-branch artifact. Root cause: sandbox drift. **Fix:** Section 4 "Cowork research discipline" rule now binds — API-only reads with `ref: main`.
- **2026-08-09 · Cowork miss #11 (stale-branch grep class, CC-caught):** Cowork's sandbox claimed `src/pages/admin/ClientsConversations.tsx` is a 20-line placeholder and `Admin.tsx:322` mounts it as a route. CC's fresh-clone check on main: `ClientsConversations.tsx` is a full 1,927-line component (the rich three-column Conversations UI from the owner's screenshot), and it's mounted at `Admin.tsx:396-398`, not `:322-323`. Cowork also conflated `CommunicationsAdmin.tsx` (notification-log surface) with `ClientsConversations.tsx` (rich inbox) — different surfaces. Same root cause as #10 — Cowork reading a stale-branch snapshot. **Fix:** same as #10 — Section 4 discipline block. Also flags that Cowork's earlier "route mount is a placeholder" and "routing gap" notes in the Communications entry were WRONG — the real Communications architecture is fully shipped per CC's verified check; the Communications SHIPPED entry in Section 4 is the CC-verified rewrite.
- **2026-08-09 · Cowork miss #12 (fabricated-progress class, second occurrence):** Cowork attempted to push the Cowork research discipline codification directly to the master doc via `create_or_update_file` — GitHub API returned `403 Resource not accessible by integration`. Cowork's MCP token is READ-only, not write. Same pattern as miss #8 (implying commit before push). **Reality:** the codification text sat in Cowork's sandbox until CC folded it into a real commit (this one). **Lesson (now folded into Section 4 discipline block):** Cowork writes go through paste-to-CC/Codex, never direct API push. Cowork's own "I pushed it" claims are provisional until CC-verified.
- **2026-08-09 · Cowork miss #3 (REVERSED by CC's live-prod check, task #31 §30 diagnose):** miss #3 above claimed `signup_intake` table does NOT exist. **Reality:** `signup_intake` DOES exist on prod (CC queried it directly — columns `user_id, account_type, agreement_slug, agreement_version, terms_accepted_at, plan_slug, billing_period, consumed_at, …`). It is the pre-provisioning per-user signup intake (no `tenant_id`); the tenant-level agreement acceptance lands in `legal_acceptances` (+ `profiles.terms_accepted_at`) via `provision_tenant`. Miss #3 was itself wrong — do not cite. CC's code check is authoritative.
- **2026-08-09 · Task #31 §30 diagnose — handoff schema corrections (CC live-prod check, PR #415, owner §32.c-gated):** the revenue-integrity handoff assumed a schema that prod disagrees with on EVERY gate. Corrected + bound to the real tables in migration `20260815120000`: (a) the paid discriminator is `tenant_revenue_classification.revenue_class` (a dedicated operator-only table, #29), NOT a `tenants.revenue_class` column (which doesn't exist and would break §51); (b) GATE 1 agreement = `legal_acceptances` filtered to the tier SUBSCRIBER slugs `saas-standalone`/`saas-agency`/`saas-enterprise` — NOT `signed_agreements` (no such table) and NOT `paige_signed_agreements` (that's CLIENT-scoped, tenant↔client, §38 tenant-side), and NOT any ambient privacy/terms/esign acceptance (§39 caught the slug-agnostic no-op); (c) GATE 2 payment = `platform_subscriptions` `status='active'` + non-null `stripe_subscription_id` — NOT a `stripe_payments` table (none) and NOT Stripe status `'succeeded'` (that's a PaymentIntent status; a subscription is `active`/`past_due`/`canceled`/…); (d) enforcement is a CONSTRAINT TRIGGER, NOT the handoff's `CHECK (… EXISTS(…))` — Postgres CHECK constraints cannot contain subqueries (invalid SQL); (e) GATE 3 atomicity ALREADY holds — `provision_tenant` is one `SECURITY DEFINER` function. Verified: `promotional 8 / internal_test 1 / paid 0`; the 3 live `active` platform_subscriptions are all comped (NULL `stripe_subscription_id`), which is why `status` alone can't be the gate.
- **2026-08-09 · Task #31 §5/§32 self-catch (CC honest log):** CC's own first `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` proof went GREEN while the ACTUAL migration did NOT apply — the proof tested a re-typed trigger body, not the file. The §5 compliance officer, running the real file in an ephemeral PG, caught a malformed `RAISE` (one `%`/`%%` placeholder vs three args → "too many parameters specified for RAISE") that aborts the whole migration on CREATE and would brick provisioning on first fire. **Lesson (§32/§13):** a `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` proof must exercise the REAL committed SQL, byte-for-byte, not a paraphrase — a green proof of a paraphrase is a false green. Fixed + re-proven against the verbatim file (COMPILE PASS + reject/accept/edit paths).
- **2026-08-09 · Cowork miss #21 (trademark-exposure class, owner-caught):** the internal codename "Jarvis Initiative" (and its "JARVIS" analog references — Marvel/Disney's distinctive Iron-Man AI character) had leaked past the internal-only boundary the strategy doc itself set. GitHub `search_code` against `main` confirmed ZERO code hits (rule held on the code side) but **14 hits across 4 doc files** — `docs/product/BRD-MVP-2026-08-08.md` (8), `docs/product/agent-ui-placement-spec.md` (2), `docs/product/interactive-analytics-ui-spec.md` (2), `docs/strategy/owner-trilogy-2026-07-26.md` (2 + the analog mapping table). Repo is public. (Cowork's original count was "8 hits"; CC's fresh-clone grep found 14 — logged as the real number, §13.) **Fix:** all 14 references purged in one docs-only PR (#417) — reframed to "Systems Check MVP" / "the operator-AI-COO archetype", and the Iron-Man analog mapping table deleted outright. **Prevent-recurrence:** new **§50 Trademark hygiene** doctrine added to `CLAUDE.md` — a mechanical case-insensitive grep on every §5/§39 pass. Owner-caught this class of leak; doctrine now catches it going forward. **§32.b grep proof (honest, meta-exempt):** post-purge, `git grep -ri "jarvis" -- 'docs/**' 'CLAUDE.md' 'src/**' 'supabase/**'` returns **live-use hits: 0 · code hits: 0 (src/**, supabase/** clean) · meta-exempt hits: 2** — this very corrections-log entry (a §13 audit trail MUST name what it reversed) and the `CLAUDE.md` §50 prohibition list (a doctrine list MUST name the marks it prohibits, exactly like §25 CHEESY-TELLS names the tells). Both are self-referential purge/prohibition surfaces, not product-name association — an IP bot finding *"we prohibit JARVIS"* / *"we purged Jarvis Initiative on this date"* is the OPPOSITE of the exposure. §50 carves out these two surfaces explicitly so future §5/§39 grep passes `grep -v` them instead of false-positiving.
- **2026-08-09 · §36 CATASTROPHIC MISS (owner-caught live; the anchoring case for §52) — now FIXED:** on Antonio's live Super-Admin Paige chat (`/admin/playbook`), Paige asked the FOUNDER *what his role was*, asked him for the platform's North Star / BRD / System Architecture (all shipped, owner-locked material), and claimed *"no memory persistence layer wired into this session"* — factually wrong (`paige_owner_memory` ships in migration `20260810120000` / PR #406; the runtime just never read it). For an AI COO that is a category-defining §36 failure. **Root cause (§30 diagnosis):** the chat system prompt is assembled inline in `paige-ai-chat/index.ts` with NO owner-identity/platform-context read; the Super-Admin surface (`PaigePlatformDesk.tsx`) even self-documented the gap ("no dedicated platform persona yet … owed server-side follow-up"). Two further §30 catches the handoff's Layer-1 assumptions missed: (a) `paige_owner_memory` is a memory-ROW table (`memory_type`+`content`), not a YAML blob; (b) the God account (`admin@paigeagent.ai`, `ba352c23`) is TENANT-LESS (`active_tenant_id` NULL, no membership) → the own-read RLS could never match → read via service-role + a migration relaxing `tenant_id NOT NULL`. **Fix:** §52 runtime context-loading substrate (PR #424, §32.a GREEN on prod) — Paige now opens every operator session already briefed (identity from `paige_owner_memory`, live platform state, compiled doctrine/master excerpts, by-name greeting from runtime auth metadata not the repo). **§13 honesty correction baked into the fix:** an edge function CANNOT read the repo (`CLAUDE.md`/master doc) at runtime, so "read from repo at compose time" was a lie — the doctrine index + master excerpt ship as COMPILED CONSTANTS versioned with the code. New `CLAUDE.md §52` makes any operator surface that asks the operator to establish who he is a §52/§36 violation. **OWED:** the owner's §32.c live-drive is the blocking proof (Paige greets Antonio by name, never asks identity). **✅ §32.c CONFIRMED live (2026-08-10):** Antonio's `/admin/playbook` session — Paige replies by name; a follow-up (PR #426) made the OPENING bubble lead with his name too. Both merged + live.
- **2026-08-09 · Cowork miss #28 (§38 doctrine drift, owner-caught pre-build):** the original Systems Check paste **and** the CC Systems Check L2 Runner paste both recommended a **"Stripe-native read"** for check #10 (payment methods) and a Stripe-specific check for #9 (payment processors). Owner correctly flagged this **violates §38** (tenant-BYO-processor; Paige is never merchant of record for tenant→client, and never assumes WHICH tool a tenant uses for anything Paige doesn't own). **Corrected PRE-BUILD:** both checks are **processor-agnostic capture-first** — the tenant declares which processor (`tenants.payment_processor_declared`: stripe/paypal/square/bank_merchant/quickbooks_payments/manual/not_yet) and which methods (`tenants.payment_methods_declared[]`); the runner reads the declared field, never a processor API. Per-processor deep-verify (a connected Stripe account's live methods, a PayPal API, etc.) lives as a **post-MVP Playbook slice** (§35 Marketplace Check Spec DSL). The correction landed in the L2 Runner PR: the migration also flips the L1 seed row #10 off `stripe_payment_methods_read`/`external_vendor` onto `payment_methods_declared`/`native_seam`, and rewrites the #9/#10 remediation copy to processor-agnostic language (the drafted fix was still saying "Stripe" — §39 F1). **Prevent-recurrence:** a new **§38 bullet** in `CLAUDE.md` makes processor/vendor-agnostic the rule for **every** tenant-side check/surface (not just the money leg): assumption-baking is a §38 violation regardless of build-cost, checked by the §5 compliance officer in both the read path and the drafted-remediation copy.
- **2026-08-10 · Twilio One Console layout flip (ops learning):** the old `console.twilio.com/us1/develop/...` deep-links now 404 in the new `1console.twilio.com` UI. Fastest path: the top-right **search bar** → type the resource name (TwiML, Messaging Services, Phone Numbers) → jump. The "All Products" catalog view is marketing/discovery, NOT operational config.
- **2026-08-10 · Messaging Service "Defer to sender's webhook" is a footgun (ops learning, root cause of the earlier operator-SMS-inbound-points-at-voice-twiml bug):** if the number's own webhook is misconfigured (or points at the wrong handler, e.g. `voice-twiml`), the Messaging Service silently falls through and inbound breaks in production unseen. **Best practice:** set the SERVICE to "Send a webhook" with the correct URL, and BLANK the number-level webhook (the service always wins).
- **2026-08-10 · `verify_jwt` is verifiable headless via `list_edge_functions` MCP (ops learning):** grep the fn by slug (output is large). Cheap ground-truth check before pointing Twilio at a fn: `verify_jwt=false` → Twilio can hit it with just its `X-Twilio-Signature`; `verify_jwt=true` → Twilio requests 401. `paige-operator-sms-inbound` confirmed `verify_jwt=false` + ACTIVE before wiring.
- **2026-08-10 · Operator-scope handler naming pattern (§9/§12 convention):** `paige-operator-<action>` (`paige-operator-sms-inbound`, `paige-operator-sms-send`) + "Paige Operator <Product>" in the Twilio console. Extend this pattern for future operator-scope handlers (RCS, WhatsApp, Voice AI) — keeps the §9 operator/tenant seam obvious.
- **2026-08-10 · Overclaimed "Fleet Comms parity done" on #431 merge (§13, owner-caught live):** the last Twilio handoff + prior Section 4 update marked Fleet Comms parity COMPLETE. PREMATURE. #431 shipped the operator-side rich three-column SHELL + phone-in-thread WIRING, but the actual product capability — Super Admin auto-populated with real contacts + conversations synced from completed tenant onboardings, inline call records, immediate operator-side email/SMS against real data — is NOT there. Antonio live-drove Super Admin and confirmed the EMPTY state. **Correction:** Section 4 entry rewritten from "✅ COMPLETE" to "🟡 shell+wiring shipped, parity NOT complete"; real completion filed as **Fleet Comms Slice 4 (task #97 / doc #15)**, sequenced behind #9 (depends on the People/Pipeline foundation). Do not re-mark parity closed until Slice 4 actually ships. Lesson: a shipped SHELL/wiring is not shipped CAPABILITY — verify the real end-to-end product behavior (§32.c) before writing "complete" in SHIPPED.
- **2026-08-10 · Featherless "model=null" was a TRACE artifact, not a config-unset bug (§30 diagnose, task #19/#103; owner-side plan closed):** the LLM-failover handoff hypothesized the cheap tier passes `model=null` (config unset OR a non-existent slug). **CC live-prod check disagrees:** `paige_llm_trace` last 48h = 50 featherless rows, ALL `status=error`, ALL `job_kind=text:open-flexible`, error `"Featherless call failed or returned no choice"`, last at 09:00 UTC (BEFORE the plan activated). The `model=null` in the trace is a **fidelity artifact** of `emit(provider, null, "error")` logging the null response object — NOT the slug actually sent. Both router seams already pass a **valid, allow-listed** slug and are already env-overridable; there was **no null-slug code bug**. Real root cause = pre-plan reachability (free tier couldn't serve the model). **Owner-side closed:** Antonio subscribed Featherless **"Feather Per-Request" DEVELOPER** ($50/mo credit, per-request billing, NO model-size cap) on 2026-08-10 — §34 cheap-tier economics restored. **Code close-loop (PR #438, MERGED 2026-08-10):** `_shared/model-router.ts` — open-flexible default upgraded 8B→`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` (owner's ranked #1, already allow-listed + already used for `internal_first_draft`), env name `FEATHERLESS_DEFAULT_MODEL` added as the §10 primary override (back-compat alias `FEATHERLESS_CHEAP_MODEL`), stale "15B cap on Basic / flat-rate by size tier" comment corrected to the per-request DEVELOPER reality; `config-registry.md` updated (§BRAIN.3). Complementary to **HOTFIX A / PR #436** (the callModel→Claude rescue for this exact path lives there, NOT in this PR — both need to be live for the full §34 no-single-provider guarantee). §32.b headless-proven (env-precedence resolver + regression-lint GREEN); **reachability of the 70B on the paid plan is NOT verifiable headless (no key value, no operator JWT, no browser) → OWED to owner §32.c live-drive** (fresh operator Systems Check scan → `operator_llm_failover` returns to `pass`). **Post-merge §32 GREEN:** `deploy-edge-functions` CI succeeded on the #438 merge commit (`830842b1`) — the router change is live on prod. Section 4 SHIPPED entry added on merge (per the Fleet-Comms lesson — no "shipped" before the merge).
- **2026-09-04 · A carrier registration no Solo tenant could ever file (§58 silent regression + §70, found while building #924):** `comms-a2p-register`'s `missingProfile()` blocks brand filing until eighteen `tenant_legal_profile` columns are populated, four of which are the authorized representative's first name, last name, email and business title. Migration `20261020020000` derived all four from the named Team member. Migration `20261046000000` then **replaced** `save_solo_setup_identity` with a version whose INSERT and ON CONFLICT lists omit all four, and `save_tenant_legal_profile_owner` never wrote them either — so **no code path in the product wrote them at all**. Verified by grep across every migration and all of `src/`: zero writers. Consequence: `missing_profile_fields` could never empty, the "Business profile" stage read *Waiting* forever, and **"Start secure brand registration" was permanently disabled for every Solo workspace**. The capability regressed silently in a persistence-repair PR and no screen said so; the owner reported it as "these fields have no Add/Edit/Save path", which was the visible half of a deeper break. **Fix (#924):** `20261201000700` derives the four at the table from the named active Team member, so every writer is correct by construction rather than each carrying a copy of the derivation — which is exactly how they were lost — plus a second trigger on `tenant_members` so a departure removes the name rather than the next unrelated Setup save. Backfilled unconditionally. **Lesson, filed in `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md`:** when a readiness list never empties, check that something actually WRITES what it is checking — a capability can be missing a writer rather than a UI, and no surface will say so.
- **2026-09-04 · Corrects a premise that reached the owner: Setup and Registration were NEVER two records that could drift (§13, #924).** A plan put to the owner proposed unifying "two copies". There is already ONE canonical record: `save_solo_business_context` → `save_solo_setup_context` → `save_solo_setup_identity` writes `public.tenant_legal_profile` in the same transaction as the Setup relations, and that is the exact row `comms-a2p-register` reads. Nothing needed unifying. Registration needed to become a second **editor** of a record that was already single — which is what shipped. Related correction: Setup's business-profile fields (`sicCode`, `naicsCode`, regions, suite line, the sealed tax number) **do** have real edit controls; they sit behind the "Edit business context" toggle, so a screenshot in read mode shows "Not provided" with no visible control. The missing path was in Registration.
- **2026-09-04 · A wider `select()` is not a safe fix when column grants are in play (§39 peer-gate catch, #924).** `hasLeftPreparation` reads three provider SIDs the Solo query never selected, so three of the server's eight immutability conditions were inert and a carrier-linked registration could be offered an editor and a PAID model call the server would refuse. The obvious repair — select the three columns — would have been a **total outage**: `20261201000600` revoked `select` on `tenant_a2p_registrations` from `authenticated` and re-granted a column list excluding exactly those three, so the read returns `permission denied for column`, which `useSoloA2P` reports as `unreadable`, which blanks Registration for **every** workspace. 1,454 tests, a clean build and a green type ratchet all passed, because the test double ignored its `select()` argument. Fixed by recovering the three conditions from `comms-a2p-register`'s server-computed `has_brand`/`has_campaign`/`has_messaging_service` booleans, and by asserting the requested column list against the real grant in test. **Lesson:** column-level grants are deliberate on this platform; a doubled client that answers any select is a model of a database with no privileges, and erases exactly this class of bug.

## 15. Paige Skills Inventory — what Paige DOES at professional level

The Paige Skills Inventory documents what Paige DOES at professional level — the atomic capabilities that
make her the AI-COO for client-based service businesses (coaches, consultants, agencies, thought leaders,
advisors). It complements the GOAT Anchor Registry (§14 — whose thinking anchors her methodology). **This is
what she executes; that is what she reasons from.** Investor-facing IP disclosure alongside the GOAT registry;
both together document the intelligence layer as an acquirable, defensible asset.

**IP posture (unchanged from §14):** skill mechanics live in `paige_skills` rows as mechanic-descriptive text
(no branded framework names, no anchor person names hardwired). Attribution lives in the GOAT registry only.
Paige's conversational chat may pay occasional taste-level homage; hardwired defaults never.

**Seeding strategy (per §62):** platform baseline skills for each category are pulled from OSS skill repos
(Anthropic Skills registry + community aggregators + owner-curated local skills) and distilled
mechanic-descriptive per §14. Tenants additionally load their own GitHub-repo skills (tenant-loadable-skills
surface, a follow-up wave). Sourcing lineage recorded in migration commit bodies only, never in a row.

**Sequencing gate (owner ruling, 2026-08-11):** ALL 12 categories must be seeded before Task #126 (Paige
web-browser install) begins — the professional-skills library is the operating instinct that drives Paige's
browsing intelligence; the library comes first, the browser comes after.

**The 12 categories (~100 skills):** (1) **Vision & Strategy** — vision interpret/create, roadmap + daily-action
translation, where-you-are diagnostic, gap analysis, scaling roadmap, quarterly OKR planning, risk id. (2)
**Client Delivery** — onboarding, kickoff agenda, per-client milestone tracking, deliverable drafting,
check-in cadence, wrap-up/graduation, reactivation. (3) **Sales & Growth** — lead triage, outreach drafting,
follow-up sequences, pipeline mgmt, forecast, competitive intel, discovery prep/summary, proposal drafting,
objection-handling library. (4) **Marketing & Content** — content strategy, brand-voice enforcement, blog/
social(per-platform)/newsletter/ad/landing-page drafting, campaign planning, email-sequence design, SEO audit,
performance report. (5) **Document Creation** (Studio §19) — offer letter, proposal, contract (basic),
welcome/follow-up email, meeting recap/agenda, one-pager, case study, ebook/guide, checklist, sales letter,
SOP, onboarding/offboarding packet, invoice/SOW, dunning notice, testimonial outline, board deck, landing
page, funnel steps — each offers Word/GDoc/PDF/Markdown (S1d shipped). (6) **Analytics Interpretation** —
revenue/pipeline/engagement reads, funnel diagnosis, cohort analysis, churn detection, ad-spend efficiency,
client-health, weekly-review/QBR/quarterly synthesis. (7) **Team Management & Building** — JD drafting,
interview design + questions, role/org mapping, hiring pipeline, onboarding sequence, review templates, 1:1
agenda, comp benchmarking, PIP script, offboarding, sub-account team building. (8) **Financial Ops** (not
accounting advice) — invoice gen+send, dunning, cash-flow snapshot, reconciliation prep, month-end close,
price analysis, tax-prep organizer. (9) **Compliance & Legal** (basic — escalate for real) — contract review,
NDA triage, policy lookup, risk assessment, escalation routing. (10) **Operations & Process** — SOP/runbook

### Tenant account redesign prototype (2026-08-21)

- ✅ A front-end-only, representative-data tenant experience prototype is available at `/tenant-redesign`. It demonstrates the six-destination IA (Home, Clients, Work, Studio, Insights, Settings), persistent PAIGE command spine, contextual artifact/CRM workspace, five connected design flows, concurrent work, voice state, and inline Trust Compass approval.
- ✅ The implementation contract is `docs/handoff/tenant-account-redesign.md`; it contains the audit, alternatives, selected Command Spine direction, screen/component inventories, tokens, responsive/motion/state specifications, old→new navigation map, interaction contracts, agent/artifact/trust rules, exact system copy, mock/functional boundary, accessibility requirements, and exportable assets.
- ❗ This is not a backend-connected tenant surface and is not evidence of live records, integrations, agent runs, approvals, sends, or deliveries. Its state is local and representative. Existing `/business/*`, `/solo/*`, and `/agency/*` routing is unchanged.

### Tenant redesign visual elevation (2026-08-21)

- ✅ `/tenant-redesign` retains the approved six-destination IA, Command Spine, contextual Workspace, five flows, shared conversation, agent orchestration, structured CRM, Trust Compass, responsive intent, and representative-only boundary while adding the authored PAIGE material, typography, intelligence-state, geometric agent, Sovereign authority, and Workspace materialization systems.
- ✅ PR #560 findings are resolved: the prototype route is excluded from the global `FloatingChatbot`, and all destination transitions close Workspace/navigation and dismiss PAIGE on mobile without changing the approved product model.
- ❗ The route remains a front-end design prototype. Voice, orchestration, persistence, approvals, delivery, integrations, CRM mutations, and all shown business activity remain mocked; no production backend capability is claimed.

### Tenant redesign laptop-fit + spatial interaction (2026-08-21)

- ✅ `/tenant-redesign` now fits a `100dvh` application shell with independent region scrolling, height-aware laptop density, folded/expanded/wide/focus PAIGE modes, docked/folded/floating/focus Workspace modes, and activity/trust/transcript/command slide-outs.
- ✅ Representative interactions preserve the current flow, draft, Workspace object/mode, active work, and business context within the session. Floating work is viewport-constrained and has keyboard movement/size alternatives; mobile destination transitions retain the PR #560 fix.
- ❗ This remains a front-end design prototype. Spatial UI state is functional; voice, orchestration, persistence, approval memory, delivery, CRM mutation, and integrations remain mocked.

### Repository-grounded account + PAIGE symbol prototype refinement (2026-08-21)

- ✅ The `/tenant-redesign` state lab now demonstrates the existing Solo, sub-account, agency parent/entered sub-account, Super Admin/God, and client placement taxonomy without inventing a hierarchy. Business scope and CRM client context are separate; business changes clear prior tenant conversation/Workspace/agent/memory/Trust/draft state.
- ✅ Shared `PaigeSymbol` adds typed Command, Sovereign, and provisional Artifact territories. The prototype demonstrates semantic state, dark/light, spectral/monochrome, and favicon forms.
  - **§13 correction (2026-09-06):** the earlier "while preserving `PaigeMark` compatibility" is SUPERSEDED — the orbital `PaigeMark` is RETIRED platform-wide (owner ruling 2026-09-06). The current identity is the **Command Mark** (`src/components/brand/PaigeCommandMark.tsx` surface-agnostic; `src/operator/shell/CommandMark.tsx` in-shell). `PaigeMark.tsx` was deleted; all runtime call sites migrated; a `lint:legacy-mark` guard + eslint `no-restricted-imports` prevent its return. `PaigeSymbol`'s command branch now renders `PaigeCommandMark`. See `docs/brain/decision-log.md` (2026-09-06 BRAND entry) + `docs/brain/glossary.md` (Command Mark).
- ❗ Account and symbol states remain representative. No React state or symbol authorizes cross-account access. Production requires `user_roles` / `tenant_members` / `agency_team_members` separation, server membership, RLS, real/effective actor logging, operator act-as, two-key break-glass, and append-only audit.

### Tenant capability recovery architecture (2026-08-21)

- ✅ The tenant redesign now maps real repository capabilities into the approved six-destination shell through destination-specific secondary navigation, a first-class Pipeline composition, durable Work runs, the existing immersive Vibe Studio family, evidence-state Insights, and complete Settings groups.
- ✅ `docs/handoff/tenant-capability-recovery-matrix.md` is the checked-in evidence ledger; `docs/handoff/tenant-platform-route-map.md` is the integration route contract. Existing operational routes remain intact until component reuse, authorization, Trust behavior, redirects, and acceptance tests are verified.
- ✅ The generic `FloatingChatbot` is suppressed on `/admin` as well as the newer authenticated shells, preventing a redundant support-style launcher inside tenant operation.
- ❗ `/tenant-redesign` remains representative and front-end only. Its links expose current operational homes; it does not inherit their authorization or call their Supabase/Edge seams.

### Tenant/client data-honesty correction (2026-08-21)

- ✅ Unverified business and CRM names were removed from the public tenant redesign. The prototype now embeds no tenant list and no CRM rows; protected operational surfaces remain the only route to live records.
- ✅ The switcher contract is server-authorized: current tenant for solo/sub-account, authorized agency subset for agency users, audited registry/act-as for operators, and tenant-scoped `clients` only inside CRM context.
- ❗ Live production names were not asserted because this checkout has no authenticated GitHub remote or Supabase management/database session. An unavailable authority yields an empty state, never invented data.

### Tenant redesign requirement gap audit (2026-08-21)

- ✅ `docs/handoff/tenant-redesign-gap-audit.md` compares the full Capability Recovery handoff against actual code and classifies each requirement as delivered, partial, owed, or production-only.
- ✅ Floating-chat suppression is centralized and regression-tested across `/tenant-redesign`, `/admin`, `/agency`, `/business`, `/solo`, `/operator`, and `/app` roots and descendants.
- ❗ Honest completion state: Phase 1 substantially complete; Phase 2 partial; Phase 3 early; Phase 4 prototype-only; Phase 5 not started. Deep links and representative compositions are not connected component integration.

### Connected-surface navigation contract (2026-08-21)

- ✅ `/tenant-redesign` sub-views now select URL-addressable Canvas states inside the persistent six-destination/PAIGE shell; duplicate legacy bridge controls are removed.
- ✅ Exactly one shared, same-tab `Migration bridge / temporary` fallback is allowed per unmounted connected surface and is registered in the recovery matrix.
- ❗ Bridge-backed surfaces remain incomplete. A bridge disappears only when the named existing component is mounted without legacy chrome and passes its tier, Trust, deep-link, and acceptance tests.

### Vibe Studio production reconciliation (2026-08-21)

- ✅ Studio is classified as substantial live code plus connected substrate—not a concept and not a fully integrated lifecycle. The supplied audit reports 17 sessions, 4 versions, and zero Library/deliverable/critique rows.
- ✅ `docs/handoff/vibe-studio-integrity-audit.md`, `scripts/audit-studio-rls.sql`, and the matrix's 20-row Studio annex establish the integrity-first proof and implementation gates.
- ❗ The real Studio is not mounted in `/tenant-redesign`. Production reportedly contains widening permissive policy shapes not present in the repository's intended narrow session/version policy design; exact live policy proof and authenticated multi-user testing block broad mounting.

### Business Vault and Marketplace truth pass — 2026-08-21

The tenant redesign now separates Settings / Business Vault, Marketplace, and Installed Capabilities by lifecycle. Business Vault is a defined but mostly owed unified product over distributed sources; Marketplace has live catalog/install/economic substrate but incomplete verified lifecycle UX; Capabilities owns operation after installation. The checked-in audit and recovery-matrix annexes preserve supplied production evidence without embedding it as UI data. No secret table is treated as a tenant Vault, no Vault health score is fabricated, and `/tenant-redesign` remains front-end-only.

### Two-way portal and dual-theme pass — 2026-08-21

`/tenant-redesign` now supports remembered light and dark modes and includes Portal as an incomplete Clients sub-view. The portal is defined as the external half of the shared client relationship—not a parallel CRM, inbox, or operator chat. A checked-in audit and 26-row matrix annex preserve the supplied production evidence and block “complete” status on identity, canonical conversation, shared work, tenant/account isolation and authenticated acceptance proof.

The two-way portal design was subsequently deepened from a landing preview into coordinated staff/client surfaces: six client destinations, structured action cards, one PAIGE conversation state, explicit audiences, human handoff continuity, and a staff Portal view with privacy projections. No connectivity claim changed.

### Illuminated Precision hero pass — 2026-08-21

The tenant prototype now implements Signal Field, Living Lineage, Creation Chamber, and Execution Theater as interactive representative surfaces. Studio navigation is defensive against missing view lookups, laptop-height Home spacing is corrected, Data Health is an Insights observation surface, and the redundant desktop PAIGE header launcher is removed. Automated shell tests cover all six destinations, Studio rendering, and persistent theme switching. The browser screenshot/deployment limitation is recorded without fabricating evidence.

### Calendar, Conversations, and spatial workspace pass — 2026-08-22

The tenant prototype now exposes canonical Calendar and Conversations mounts alongside representative, data-honest instrument anatomy. Calendar is the single time/commitment home under Work; Conversations remains under Clients. The shell adds persisted expanded/compact/canvas navigation, PAIGE as an optional command drawer, and same-application detached workspace context synchronization without moving authorization into the browser.

### Solo Command Center Mind — owner-approved build in draft review (2026-08-28)

- **Status: DRAFT PR ONLY; not shipped, merged, or deployed.** Owner-approved prototype:
  `paige-command-center-mind-flow-prototype.html`, SHA-256
  `2CE38FC21DD1C6B6DD0C5816A63E2FA09F80245F09BB73F809DA52089F69`, 57,193 bytes.
- Solo Command Center's proposed customer-facing information architecture is exactly
  **Systems Check · Mind**. Systems Check remains first/default. Retired Solo Directory and History
  addresses resolve to canonical Mind; Agency, Sub-account, Enterprise, and operator owners remain
  unchanged.
- Mind is a read-only governed record index over existing tenant-scoped owners: indexed knowledge is
  LIVE; current pending decision references are LIVE SOURCE but non-actionable here; the latest Systems Check snapshot
  is PARTIAL history. Full historical series, resolved-decision history, helper provenance, and inferred
  semantic/causal relationships remain UNAVAILABLE.
- The interactive 3D topology is a PROPOSED presentation, not a new data owner. It is still by default.
  Direct mouse/keyboard manipulation is not business activity; finite motion may occur only after a
  genuinely newly observed grounded record. One existing PAIGE workspace remains the only workspace,
  and opening it does not attach, prefill, send, prepare, or start work.
- Tenant identity remains server-resolved. The Mind data child does not mount while `activeTenantId` is
  unresolved and remounts by tenant epoch so prior-account state and late responses cannot paint the
  next account.

### Solo Systems Check Operating Signal — owner-approved build in draft review (2026-08-29)

- **Status: DRAFT PR ONLY; not shipped, merged, deployed, or production-accepted.** The owner approved
  the Operating Signal prototype and authorized implementation through a green draft PR and preview;
  the separate final go-live gate remains required.
- The Solo Systems Check is a compact business-awareness surface over the existing tenant-scoped
  `systems_check_snapshot` rail. Persisted findings are grouped into confirmed, needs-attention, and
  unavailable reads; missing or partial evidence never becomes inferred health. Refresh motion is
  finite, interruptible, and labeled as a read with no manufactured per-category progress; reduced
  motion preserves the same text and state.
- Finding detail follows the grounded chain **signal → evidence/provenance → impact → recommended next
  step → owner decision → durable outcome**. Missing interpretation, decision, or resolution records
  are stated as missing. The one existing PAIGE workspace is the only executive-rundown/action seam;
  opening it does not attach context, prefill a message, send, prepare, or start work.
- **Explicitly deferred/unavailable in this slice:** emerging trend analysis, market/competitor pulse,
  capacity watchpoints, owner-configurable watchpoints, and any separate phone/A2P readiness logic.
  A future communications read may consume only the canonical server-resolved `can_send_sms` result
  when that narrow contract exists. Systems Check does not own Settings, Calendar, Conversations,
  Mind, the shared shell, provider configuration, or new backend logic.

### Setup-owned A2P legal identity — implementation draft (2026-09-01)

- **Status:** local implementation draft; Gate 2 pending. Not merged, deployed, provider-submitted,
  or production-accepted.
- **Human owner:** each tenant confirms legal identity in Setup. The full registration number is
  write-only and vaulted; only its last four digits return to the client.
- **Canonical data:** `tenant_legal_profile` supplies legal name, entity/formation details, public
  website, structured registered address, regions, registration identifier, and an active confirmed
  Team member as authorized representative. Messaging registration consumes this record.
- **Provider architecture:** platform operator Primary Customer Profile on the Twilio master account;
  each client uses a Secondary Customer Profile and downstream Brand/Campaign/Messaging Service in
  its own subaccount. Provider identifiers and submission state are server-owned.
- **PAIGE boundary:** may explain missing fields and propose non-sensitive facts for confirmation;
  cannot invent the tax number, choose the representative, submit, purchase, or imply approval.

- **2026-09-02 — three doctrine files said the Trust Compass migration was not on production. It is.**
  `docs/doctrine/autonomy-architecture.md`, `docs/doctrine/one-approval-gate.md` and
  `docs/brain/glossary.md` each stated that `20261039000000` was *"not applied to production yet"* /
  *"neither it nor the resolver exists on prod today."* A read-only catalog query on ref
  `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu` (2026-09-02) returns `trust_effective_rung()` and
  `resolve_tool_autonomy(uuid,text)` as **existing**, with `20261039000000` and `20261040000000` in
  `schema_migrations` (910 applied = 910 repo `.sql` files, zero drift). All three corrected in place
  per §58 — struck, not deleted.
  **Why it mattered beyond bookkeeping:** `one-approval-gate.md` instructed builders *"Do not write,
  or build against, a claim that the Compass evaluates the action contract until it is persisted and
  enforced server-side."* That instruction rested on a false premise, so a slice obeying it would have
  under-built against a clamp that is in fact deployed.
  **The correction is deliberately narrow, and the caution survives in a truer form.** What was proven
  is **existence** (catalog class). **Runtime enforcement was NOT tested and remains `UNVERIFIED`** —
  and `20261019001000:41-48` separately states the compass clamps *at render only*, since
  `resolve_tool_autonomy` reads `tenant_tool_autonomy` and never reads the compass. Reconciling that
  with §4's record of `operator_rls_coverage` FAILING and already capping the ceiling 3→2 is open work
  owned by whoever holds autonomy. No approval-authority claim changed: it remains the server
  action-risk policy plus the confirmation gate.

- **2026-09-02 — "the Spine exists" was being read as "the departments are connected." They are not.**
  One registered capability (`pipeline.deal_stage_evidence`, read-only, Chat `PARTIAL`, Mind
  `UNAVAILABLE`) against **105** inline Chat tools, both measured by the repo's own guards. Recorded in
  §5 and in full in `docs/brain/paige-spine-and-rail-state.md` so no future session infers platform-wide
  Spine connectivity from the foundation's presence.

- **2026-09-02 — an absent Solo activity feed was available to be misread as an idle workspace**, and
  **my first record of it overstated how safely it fails.** `authenticated` holds no SELECT grant on
  `paige_client_events` in production, so the read fails before RLS — that part stands. But the first
  version said the hook "honestly renders an error rather than an empty feed" and called it "a dead
  capability, not a lying one." ~~*That framing.*~~ **CORRECTED (§58):** it generalised from one
  hook's internal branch to the platform's behaviour without checking any consumer. Issue **#746**
  established, and this session re-verified, that the two shipped Context Rail consumers read only
  `{ events, connected }` and that `historyError`/`historyLoaded` have no reader in `src/` — so a
  refused read renders as "nothing yet". The Solo Trust Compass consumer *does* distinguish, which is
  why the truthful status is **not reliable enough**, not *never*. Status of record: *production Rail
  history cannot be read, and the current owner-facing consumer treatment is not reliable enough to
  distinguish denied history from empty history.* **The lesson is the one this log exists for: a hook
  returning an error is not a person seeing one, and only the consumer settles that.**

### Solo Settings → Setup durable persistence repair — release candidate (2026-09-02)

The existing six-section Setup design is preserved. The repaired shared Solo flow now has a real
tenant-scoped edit/save/readback contract, honest validation, pending, failure/retry, conflict,
cancel, stale-response, account-switch, and read-only states, plus field provenance and global
legal-entity support. Business ownership records never change Team membership or workspace
authority. Owner versus Admin permission is server-enforced. Full registration identifiers are
Vault-only and masked on read; legal ownership, percentages, exact addresses, private contacts,
and representative IDs are excluded from PAIGE and Rail by default. The unsafe legacy whole-brief
PAIGE persona projection is removed pending a separately approved safe Spine contract. The exact
migration and checked-in real-role rollback proof passed against production schema. Truth remains
`PARTIAL` until exact-head deployment and authenticated Owner save, reload, reopen, and account
switch proof. Internal `paige_audit_log` attribution is not Rail.

### Two readiness reads disagree about the same two workspaces, and I shipped the second one (2026-09-03)

**§57 cross-surface parity defect, self-reported.** `business_context.readiness` (#864, migration
`20261112000000`) made Setup the only source for website and phone. `20261160000000` then added a
legacy-`tenants.brand` fallback to `tenant_comms_readiness`, to repair three flags that were wrongly
reading `false`. That repair was correct in isolation and **was not checked against the read that had
already chosen the opposite rule.**

Measured on production, executed as First Sterling Capital's real owner:

| Read | website / business_phone |
|---|---|
| `business_context.readiness` | `needs_confirmation` |
| `tenant_comms_readiness` | `has_website: true`, `has_phone: true` |

Two workspaces are affected — First Sterling Capital (`7eaf8859`, website + phone) and Antonio
Daniel LLC (`e7f1b157`, website) — and both hold **no** `tenant_legal_profile` values at all.

The open question in #868 was "should a legacy value count as on file?". The status of record is
narrower and worse: **the platform already answers it both ways at once.** Direction is an owner
decision (brief at `docs/delivery/owner-decision-legacy-brand-fallback.md`); reconciling the two
reads afterwards is not optional and does not need one.

**The lesson this log exists for:** a fix that is correct against the surface in front of you can
still be wrong against the platform. `20261160000000` was verified by executing the flags it
repaired, and never by asking what else already answered the same question.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-05 — PR #958, migration `20261221000000`.** Not by picking a winner. Both reads
were lossy: two independent facts had been compressed into one field — **A**, does a value exist at
all (yes, in the legacy record); **B**, did the owner confirm it in Setup (no). Comms answered A and
dropped B; business_context answered B and dropped A. Choosing between their answers would have
preserved one true fact by continuing to erase the other, so the canonical state now carries both,
via the new state `legacy_sourced` / source `legacy_brand` — which **extends** the
`connection_sourced`/`connections` vs `owner_confirmed`/`setup` distinction this contract already
made for `primary_business_email` rather than inventing a vocabulary.

Both reads now derive every identity fact from **one internal resolver**,
`public.business_identity_readiness`, while keeping their **different** caller gates (this one
tenant-scoped, comms on the §59 global predicate) — making either call the other would have imposed
one read's authorization on the other's callers. The resolver takes a tenant parameter and is
therefore unreachable by any caller: `EXECUTE` revoked from `PUBLIC`, `anon`, `authenticated` and
`service_role`.

**The sweep the contradiction did not announce.** Asking the same question of the neighbouring facts
found `industry` wrong in exactly the same way for **four** workspaces — twice as many — with no
second reader to contradict it, and `primary_business_email` defaulting to
`connection_sourced`/`connections` for **all three** workspaces holding a `support_email` with no
provenance recorded, naming a connected account as the proof for a value no connection ever wrote.

**The email correction was drafted and then WITHDRAWN by the §39 peer-gate, which is the part worth
remembering.** A THIRD reader of that same field exists — `get_solo_business_context()` and
`src/solo/data/useSoloBusinessContext.ts`, rendered as Setup's "Connection-sourced" badge — and it
makes the same inference. All three agree today, so flipping only the readiness reader would have
made PAIGE say "never confirmed" while Setup said "Connection-sourced" about one field in the same
second: the exact defect class being fixed, newly created by the fix. Unbundled into its own slice
that must move all three together. **Seven rows move in total; `primary_business_email` moves on
zero; zero Systems Check verdicts and zero comms booleans move**, asserted per tenant across all 14
production tenants rather than reasoned about. A contradiction is not the
defect — it is the only symptom loud enough to be seen.

**A further answer is named, not changed:** `get_tenant_a2p_registration_status().profile` echoes
`tenant_legal_profile` with no brand fallback, so it reports a null website for these workspaces.
A raw-value echo rather than a readiness contract, zero callers in-repo, A2P out of scope — recorded
in the contract doc so it is found named rather than re-discovered.

Contract, states, never-infer rules and the measured before/after:
`docs/delivery/canonical-readiness-contract.md`. Authenticated runtime proof on the deployed
surfaces is **OWED, not claimed** (§32.c).

### get_tenant_people(): the resting state is not the capability (2026-09-03)

**§58 near-miss, caught by peer review before merge (PR #885).** The `has_role(auth.uid(),'admin')`
gate on `get_tenant_people()` is tenant-agnostic (§59), and the first draft of the repair gated
solely on `is_tenant_admin()`, reporting it as a no-op for every current user on the strength of a
prod measurement.

The measurement was of the **resting state** — both operator accounts sit at `active_tenant_id =
NULL` — generalised to the **capability**. `operator_enter_tenant()` sets `active_tenant_id` and
inserts no `tenant_members` row by design, so one click of Act-as in Fleet Console falsifies it:
driven on prod, the super_admin's roster read went **3 rows → 0**. Shipped gate now also admits
`is_platform_operator()` (§53).

Also corrected: the affected population is **9**, not 7 — and all 14 `tenant_members` rows on prod
are active `owner`/`admin`, so there is **not one ordinary member on the platform**. The
wrongly-admits case the repair closes has no natural representation in the data and had to be
constructed as a fixture to prove.

**The lesson:** measuring who is affected *right now* is not measuring what the change can do. A
capability that is dormant at the moment of measurement reads as absent.

### Spine item 4 (Clients / Pipeline / Sales) — do NOT build (2026-09-03, #893)

Grounded on production. The recommendation is **do not register a Spine capability for this
domain**, for the same reason and by the same method as the Connections packet: it already has a
home, and a second one would be a rival answer rather than a new one.

**Two existing homes.** PAIGE already reads this domain through `crm_pipeline_summary`,
`crm_list_deals`, `crm_search_contacts`, `crm_get_contact_summary` and `crm_list_tasks`, plus
governed writes carrying confirm-gating. And `practice_dashboard_metrics(p_window_days)` already
aggregates it in SQL — `SECURITY DEFINER`, granted `authenticated`, tenant server-resolved,
raising `practice_scope_forbidden` on a null tenant. A third answer could disagree with the
dashboard the tenant is looking at (§57).

**What the stores hold** (measured, not inferred from a table existing): `pipeline_stages` 89 rows
across 12 tenants; `pipelines` 17/12; `clients` 7 rows across 3 tenants, so **10 of 13 workspaces
have an empty book**; `deals` 1; `tenant_products`, `tenant_prices` and
`tenant_service_subscriptions` all **0**. Structure is real; activity is not.

**`orders` is Platform Billing wearing a Sales name.** Columns `user_id`, `stripe_session_id`,
`plan_type` — and **no `tenant_id` at all**. It is a tenant paying Paige (§38 L1), never a tenant's
client paying the tenant. Reading it as Sales would attribute platform subscription revenue to
tenant sales.

**Honest states of record:** pipeline configured `LIVE`; client book `LIVE` and honestly `0` for 10
of 13; deal activity `PARTIAL` with no derivable aggregate; revenue / velocity / forecast
`UNAVAILABLE`; tenant commerce `NOT_CONNECTED`; payment completion `UNAVAILABLE` to Sales.

**Two corrections inside this packet, both self-caught before they shipped.**
1. The single deal is **not** fixture-like — real workspace, real value, staged, linked contact,
   status `open`, updated after creation. The conclusion (no aggregates) survives; the reason
   changes to *"one real deal is not a sample"*. The wrong reason would have justified the right
   answer on a basis that evaporates the moment a second deal exists.
2. I hypothesised that `practice_dashboard_metrics`' missing role gate exposed revenue aggregates
   to a workspace's own clients. **It does not** — the deployed `current_user_tenant_id()` has no
   `clients.linked_user_id` branch, so an unlinked client resolves `NULL` and is refused. I had
   conflated it with `get_paige_persona_context()`, which does resolve that branch first. Withdrawn
   rather than shipped as a finding — and the same conflation in the opposite direction turned out
   to be a genuine defect (see the CRM binding entry).

The packet also names **what would reopen the decision** — a deal population where movement is
measurable, or tenant commerce actually configured — so this is a decision with a trigger rather
than a permanent no.

### PAIGE's CRM tools now bind to the conversation's own workspace (2026-09-03, #892)

**LIVE on prod.** `main` = `edge-live` = `d7ecc4a7`, zero edge drift; `deploy-edge-functions`
green; the deployed `paige-ai-chat` carries the guard at L9029 calling
`supabaseClient.rpc("current_user_tenant_id")`, with no service-role call to that RPC anywhere in
the file.

**The defect.** Two mechanisms, neither a defect alone. (1) `crmTenantId` comes from
`get_paige_persona_context()`, which resolves the `clients.linked_user_id` branch FIRST. (2) The
tool role gate reads `public.user_roles`, which carries no `tenant_id` (§59). So a user who is
admin/coach because of workspace A and a linked client of workspace B passed the gate via A and ran
the nine `CRM_SERVICE_TOOLS` handlers against B — service-role client, RLS bypassed, four of the
nine being writes. Proven on prod in a rolled-back transaction; exposure on the one target used was
2 contact records and a $5,000 deal. Latent only because `clients.linked_user_id` is non-null on
zero prod rows, which stops being true the moment a customer-portal user is linked (§7).

**The fix.** The conversation's workspace must equal the caller's own `current_user_tenant_id()` —
the canonical resolver, which already encodes a `tenant_members` seat, `agency_can_manage_child`,
`agency_team_role` and `is_platform_admin`, so it needs no operator special-case. Resolved per tool,
deliberately not memoised. Independently re-derived across all 10 gate-passing prod users: 9
allowed, 1 already refused on `main`, **zero newly refused**.

**WHAT #892 DOES NOT CLOSE — a swept, four-site PATTERN.** A sweep of `paige-ai-chat` on `main`
after #892 found the same shape at three further tools, each pairing the global `user_roles` gate
(§59) with an action scoped by `personaCtx.tenant_id`:

| Site | What the conversation's tenant controls | Line (main @ d7ecc4a7) |
|---|---|---|
| `propose_action` | service-role insert filing an outbound draft (`cs_draft`, resolved `contact_id`) into that workspace's approval queue | gate L10995 |
| `forge_subagent` | `POST /functions/v1/subagent-forge` with the **service-role key** and `tenant_id` in the body — creates a sub-agent there | gate L10928 |
| `list_subagents` | `POST /functions/v1/paige-orchestrator` with the service-role key and `{action:"tool_invoke", slug, input, tenant_id}` — **invokes an arbitrary registered tool** in that workspace | gate L10894 |

The third is the most consequential, and its own comment states the intent: *"§9: pass the tenant
scope so the orchestrator only surfaces/invokes"* for that tenant. So `tenant_id` **is** the
downstream authority boundary — supplied by a client-link-first resolver behind a tenant-agnostic
gate.

Checked and cleared: `isOperator` (L4518) is a prompt-UX signal only; the adjacent comment confirms
`callerTier` is the real authority.

**Four instances means the PATTERN is the bug, not the site.** The fix therefore belongs in ONE
shared helper (§18), not four copies — otherwise the fifth site is written wrong the same way, which
is how this spread. Deliberately not folded into #892: widening a security PR on my own momentum is
exactly how that PR's third draft went wrong. Tracked as its own slice, needing its own peer-gate.

**§13 — three drafts, wrong three different ways, and only one caught by review.**
1. A hand-rolled `tenant_members` check, narrower than the canonical resolver; would have locked out
   an agency manager holding no seat in a child tenant they manage. Caught pre-push.
2. The right predicate called on the **service-role** client, where `auth.uid()` is NULL — the guard
   would have refused **all nine tools for all nine active operators**, converting a latent leak
   into a total outage (§58). Caught by the §39 peer-gate, on the pushed diff. Nothing shipped.
3. The check memoised across the tool batch, which made both sides equally stale and reopened the
   mid-batch scope window the loop's own dispatch-boundary comment exists to close. Caught by
   reading the code the change sat inside.

A second peer-gate cleared the final guard and found the PR body still asserting the reverted
memoisation — corrected before merge, because the record of a security change must match the change.

**Owed:** authenticated runtime proof. The edge function is not drivable from a headless session,
so the guard is proven at the database and unproven where it runs. Three drafts, two broken in ways
no typecheck, no SQL proof and no green CI could detect, is the concrete argument for the
least-privilege test tenant specified in #888.

### Solo Sales agreement schedule clarity (2026-09-03, PR #895)

The Sales agreement detail now includes the recorded renewal date, or an explicit Not stated / Not applicable value. Start, renewal and end are calendar dates and retain their recorded day across timezones. This is read-only presentation over the existing agreement source; no payment, Catalog, role or cross-workspace change. See `docs/delivery/solo-sales-agreement-schedule.md` for scope, acceptance and separated proof. Authenticated browser and production proof remain owed until recorded.


### Solo Sales workbench (2026-09-03)

Current implementation: commercial terms first, a five-row canonical offer finder with server name search/paging and exact selected-offer references, compact payment handling and expandable source-backed form/payment activity. Terms search/status filters explicitly cover the latest 200 loaded records; client identity remains the existing bounded directory, not all-history search. Catalog baseline prices, writes, six Campaigns tabs and Pipeline stay unchanged. No documents/signatures/payment collection added.

Owner superseded competing Sales PR #905; its separate Clients fix remains with that owner. R1 #903 is merged at `c198d8ae` and its production revision was verified; the older pending-release wording describes the pre-release ledger. Workbench release checks and exact deployment evidence: [Sales workbench](delivery/solo-sales-workbench.md). Local Chromium covers all four widths/both themes and simulated 1/80/80000 offers; authenticated persistence and production large-catalog performance remain **Proof Owed**. Broader Sales remains **PARTIAL**.

### Solo n8n MCP OAuth MVP decision — 2026-09-03

The owner superseded the earlier callback zero-log release block for the standard OAuth connection. Hosted gateway retention of temporary code/state URL metadata is an accepted post-release hardening risk; it is not claimed encrypted or eliminated. Existing token encryption, S256 PKCE, exact redirect, owner/session/workspace binding, replay/expiry checks and read-only initial authority remain mandatory. Scope is the entire Solo shell, with independent per-workspace connections and API health. Implementation and proof: `docs/delivery/solo-n8n-oauth-mvp.md`. This entry records the approved release contract, not successful deployment or owner consent.
Owner follow-up: OAuth must request workflow:read and workflow:write. Initial connection verification remains read-only; no workflow:execute or automatic mutation is granted. Workflow writes remain subject to the governed action path and explicit approval.

### Solo Conversations outbound Voice hotfix — 2026-09-05 (candidate)

The shared Solo Voice path had two coupled defects: the public TwiML handler accepted unproved
tenant fields and could create false owner-attributed Conversations history, while the production
API-key credential posture omitted call-status callbacks, leaving provider acceptance/rejection
unreconciled. The candidate repair stamps each tenant TwiML Application VoiceUrl with its existing
tenant webhook proof, repairs stored applications on token mint, binds provider proof to the active
tenant before any service-role work, requires a provider-bound voice-capable primary caller ID on the
same active subaccount, and scopes token authority to the caller's active tenant membership. Browser
calls are single-flight, common US local input is normalized to E.164, raw provider messages are not
shown, and Conversations labels Voice rows Initiated / Completed / Failed from persisted provider
evidence. Call history remains in `messages`; no new Rail writer was introduced.

Strict webhook enforcement has a staged release prerequisite: deploy the internal single-target
repair helper first, obtain sanitized provider success for every configured tenant app and the
operator app, then deploy the strict handler. The helper is service-role/verified-cron gated, never
enumerates tenants, forces a provider update even when a database marker exists, and returns no ids,
numbers, URLs, secrets, or payloads. Same-commit deployment without this repair is not sufficient.

Production data inspection found the reported workspace fully configured in the database and six
recent Voice rows stuck queued. Other standalone Solo workspaces had no comparable fully configured,
active Voice path, so this is a platform-path defect currently observable in that workspace—not a
workspace-only setup gap. Retrospective child-leg provider outcomes, authenticated browser behavior,
deployment persistence, and one owner-approved controlled live call remain **Proof Owed** until
performed.

- 2026-09-03 n8n owner-pass correction: PR #909 deployed but the first real consent failed before state consumption. The hosted gateway rewrites the runtime callback path/origin; public-URL-only fixtures missed this. Bounded handler repair preserves fixed redirect URI and all state/owner/session guards, fixes the 404 fallback, and is documented in docs/delivery/solo-n8n-oauth-mvp.md. Do not label the tenant connected until fresh owner consent succeeds.

### Solo orchestration MVP — A2P workspace repair, 2026-09-04 (candidate)

Owner direction authorizes implementation through green-gated release for reusable Solo orchestration, imports, external intake and SMS readiness. PAIGE remains the AI COO: read, reason, write, delegate, execute and follow through; preparation-only behavior is an unfinished capability, not a product ceiling.

The first repair closes a confirmed A2P workspace-switch defect. The editor is keyed by workspace, delayed responses are fenced, handlers pass a captured-workspace precondition, prompt context is explicitly tenant-scoped, and the save/insert trigger rejects a changed tenant rather than redirecting the write. Ordinary Solo owners/admins gain the same captured-tenant preparation authority using is_tenant_admin_as and a current-workspace SELECT policy. Carrier submission is still absent; this repair does not make SMS registration ready.

Automated evidence: UI and actual-handler tests with injected database/model ports; isolated PostgreSQL role, replay and lock-wait race tests. Independent adversarial source review passed after two additional races were corrected. Authenticated production owner-flow proof remains owed. No real customer record, workflow, campaign, carrier submission or sender identity was changed to produce proof.

### Mind / Rail / Spine / Memory / PAIGE-chat recovery lane — PR #956 (2026-09-05)

Re-grounded the stale drafts against current `main` (972 migrations applied == repo, zero drift;
#925/#939/#947 are the live Rail baseline) and shipped **small current-main releases** rather than
merging any old branch. Detail + proof-by-class: `docs/brain/decision-log.md` (Release A/B/C entries),
`docs/brain/paige-memory-contract.md`, and PR #956.

- **Release A — PAIGE Knowledge tenant safety (re-ground #591).** Four of #591's five protections were
  already delivered by the superseding SAFETY-FIRST STREAMING seam (`revalidateTenantKnowledgeScope` +
  revocation latch + `409 ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_CHANGED` before egress + per-round tool guards); the
  `sync-credit-report-data` crossing is moot (proposal-first, §70). The one still-absent protection ships
  here: `paige-ai-chat` confirms `personaCtx.tenant_id == profiles.active_tenant_id` before searching
  tenant Knowledge, refusing the `current_user_tenant_id()` oldest-membership fallback at the knowledge
  boundary (fail closed — no embed/retrieval/telemetry). `test:knowledge-scope` group 24 failing-first;
  §39 peer-gate SHIP. Blast radius measured on prod: 1 profile (null active + membership).
- **Release B — Mind safe evidence contract (re-ground #644).** #644 is superseded/regressive (returns
  forbidden `contact_id`, raw active_tenant_id, wrong flat shape) — the shipped `resolveEvidence.safeSignal`
  19-key allowlist already enforces the contract, and the binding test bans a Rail-reading resolver. Added
  `lint:rail-grants` (CI) fencing browser roles out of the raw Rail (`paige_client_events` /
  `paige_workspace_events`) — the #746 defect class. #644 → recommend close.
- **Release C — governed Memory backend contract.** Migration `20261223000000` adds three §59/§45-clean
  RPCs (`record_/get_/forget_paige_memory`) over the existing `paige_owner_memory` (no new store, §18) —
  the governed seam giving conversation + agent memory a home with all six governance fields (source,
  scope, freshness, visibility, correction, deletion). Pre-merge `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` prod proof (anon
  denied, JWT confined, 42501 fail-closed); §39 peer-gate SHIP (vocab `'identity'` fix applied).
  Chat-runtime auto-write is DEFERRED (slice 4b), labeled — the seam ships.
- **Stale-PR recovery:** #776 fully superseded by Slice B → recommend close; #729 findings 1/2/4 are on
  `main`, finding 3 (a sync **transport rejection** left the extraction claim stuck `applied` with nothing
  applied) ported with a failing-first test; #591/#644 → recommend close. #917 handed to the orchestration
  owner with a 3-lane split + the Release A authority dependency.
- **Relationship Context & Governed Memory contract** — `docs/doctrine/relationship-context-and-governed-memory-contract.md`:
  the source-of-truth + handoff map across canonical CRM facts (People/Clients, §202), governed
  relationship context (Mind/Memory), future Conversations/Transcription evidence ingestion, and
  Marketplace templates. A bounded architecture doc — no schema, UI, Marketplace feature, or transcript pipeline.

**Authenticated production runtime proof is OWED across this lane** (no signed-in owner drove the deployed
surfaces this session; `LIVE_DRIVE_*` unset). The migration's persisted-apply is CI's (`deploy-migrations.yml`).

### Solo Tenant Brain — Business Mission vertical slice, 2026-09-06 (MVP candidate)

Owner-approved first operating slice for the **Solo Tenant Brain**, distinct from Platform Brain and
not a claim that the tenant brain is complete. After the existing chat-canonical Mission approval,
the dedicated `paige-ai-chat` path now resolves the caller's active tenant and the newest Mission
canonically linked to the persisted Paige thread before reasoning, uses the existing
create/revise/transition Mission seams, re-resolves tenant, re-reads the canonical
Mission, verifies the id/revision/lifecycle and every requested persisted field, and only then calls
the existing service-role `record_capability_run` Rail writer. The stable Rail run id is the Mission
request UUID. Failed/missing/mismatched readback emits no Rail and cannot claim success.

No new chat, Mission store, approval channel, Memory store, Mind resolver or table is added. One
read-only Mission RPC plus its supporting partial index extends the existing Mission contract.
RE-2 PR-2's policy-aware resolver is merged but remains dark and is not adopted here; confirmation is
the reachable Mission authority. PR #917's orchestration/import ownership is preserved. Mission Mind
and Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`. `command-center.business-game-plan` remains `PARTIAL` pending exact-SHA
authenticated Solo-owner, denied/cross-tenant, canonical Mission and matching Rail proof. Current
contract and proof ledger: `docs/brain/solo-tenant-brain.md`,
`docs/delivery/solo-tenant-brain-business-mission-mvp.md`, and
`docs/binding-ledger/surface-binding-ledger.json`.
### Solo Settings → Setup → Public Presence — released (2026-09-06)

Owner-approved placement is the second Setup child: `Business profile | Public Presence | People & email`. The shared `Settings · Setup / Business context` banner is removed from every Setup child; the ordinary Setup editor keeps a compact, task-specific edit strip, while Public Presence uses its own operating actions. No `/admin` route, Agency surface, or sub-account surface was added.

Public Presence coordinates outward use of the existing canonical Setup brief; it does not create an identity store. `owner_confirmed` is shown only when the canonical field provenance is both owner-confirmed and confirmed. A saved website is labelled as a Business Profile URL, never as indexed or discoverable. Google Business Profile, Apple Business Connect, Bing Places, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, directory networks, search/indexing, reviews, provider writes, bounded delegated authority, Rail evidence, and the dedicated PAIGE context handoff remain `UNAVAILABLE` because no authenticated source/worker contract exists. Unavailable work is presented as a visible explanatory state instead of a dead control; no connected, claimed, matched, synced, corrected, published, ranking, traffic, rating, review-count, or score claim is made.

Release proof: PR #1021 passed its CI, Security Audit, and UI-delivery-evidence workflows and squash-merged to `main` as `d4392b9786e68ce44b72905f3ffe6771aea319ab`. Both `https://paigeagent.ai/version.json` and `https://app.paigeagent.ai/version.json` returned `d4392b9786e68ce44b72905f3ffe6771aea319ab-mtqao86w`, proving the exact product merge SHA is deployed. Local proof remains: 129 focused Setup/Public Presence/routing assertions pass; changed-file ESLint, the TypeScript ratchet, regression lint, binding-ledger lint, and production build pass. The full repository run passed 3,770/3,775 under parallel load; all five affected unrelated suites then passed 73/73 in isolation. A compiled local component harness proved no page-level horizontal overflow or nested vertical scroller at 1536×770, 1366×768, 1024×768, 900×1000, and 390×844; Mineral and Obsidian rendered; mobile primary targets reach 44px; drawer Escape, background containment, body lock, and focus restoration passed with no browser errors. The harness was removed after capture. A production browser reached the exact route and was correctly redirected to `/auth?next=%2Fsolo%2F100%2Fsettings%2Fsetup%2Fpublic-presence`; signed-in owner interaction, workspace switching, and real tenant data remain `PROOF OWED` and must not be inferred from deployment or local evidence.

Integration Capability Registry dependency (owner ruling, effective 2026-09-06): refreshed `origin/main` has no Integration Capability Registry entry or identifiable Registry Steward record for Public Presence. This slice does not create a competing registry and does not depend on provider authority: every provider, PAIGE handoff, review, claim, correction, publish, and external-execution action remains `UNAVAILABLE`. Registry Steward notification is required before the next provider-facing slice. That owner must first add the canonical entry with exact provider capability and scopes, tenant-tier eligibility separate from role authority, standing-authority lane, M1 dependency, provider-confirmed outcome path, Rail/Mind/Memory boundaries, proof state, and limitations. Only then may a provider slice implement server-resolved tenant scope, freshness/read failures, exact venue/account scope, governed action, verified provider result, and attributable evidence.

Legacy collision/source map: `src/components/dashboard/business-profile/PublicPresenceSection.tsx`, mounted by `BusinessInfrastructureAssessment.tsx`, reads and writes `business_public_presence`, calculates completion from owner-entered URLs/self-check booleans, and reports only the local database save. `supabase/functions/paige-write-back/index.ts` also exposes `public_presence.*` writes to that table and currently records success without validating the write result. Those records are **not** the canonical Business Profile, authenticated provider state, public-source evidence, or a provider-confirmed outcome. They must not feed this Public Presence surface, PAIGE context, Rail, Mind, or Memory. The Business Infrastructure Assessment and `paige-write-back` owners own retirement or explicit reconciliation to canonical Business Profile facts plus real provider evidence; this slice deliberately does not modify that active legacy path.

#### Provider-preparation MVP candidate (2026-09-06)

The remaining Settings-level Setup banner and decorative Public Presence route eyebrow are removed; Setup remains in shell navigation and the sticky child bar. The one dedicated Paige workspace now accepts a pointer to the intended Public Presence step. `paige-ai-chat` re-resolves the authenticated tenant through `get_public_presence_paige_context()` and permits only owner-confirmed public facts, website/domain, completed/missing steps, source freshness, connection state, and effective authority. Cross-tenant/malformed/live-provider claims fail closed; client and Public Presence focus cannot coexist. Secrets, OAuth tokens, Vault, billing, private documents, raw reviews, and uploads do not enter the handoff, Rail, Mind, or Memory.

The authoritative Integration Capability Registry now contains Google Search Console and Google Business Profile as `UNAVAILABLE`, plus the complete Steward packet for Bing Webmaster, Apple Business Connect, Yelp, Facebook, LinkedIn, and directory networks. Search Console remains first and read-only; Business Profile remains second and requires provider-specific tenant consent, account/location selection, source-backed fact comparison, receipt/readback, and Rail evidence before any result can be claimed. No provider connection, Google project, OAuth credential, provider call, review/listing/post action, or external execution exists in this candidate.

Candidate proof is 76 focused tests, TypeScript, both registry gates, and 114 compiled Settings-shell render states. Sticky clearance, zero redundant chrome, one scroll owner, no horizontal overflow, dedicated Paige-workspace opening, both themes, all four required viewports, and 390×844 mobile 44px actions pass. Real-Deno CI, authenticated tenant behavior, exact merge/deployment proof, and signed-in production verification remain `PROOF_OWED` until release closeout.


Provider-preparation release closeout: PR #1034 passed the complete required CI suite and merged as fead7dfd03cd0ec1ee5c0c9f7854f067de484239. Production database run 34070351481 and Edge Function run 34070351556 succeeded for that SHA. Both production version endpoints returned fead7dfd03cd0ec1ee5c0c9f7854f067de484239-mtqig2jk. This proves code, migration, Edge deployment, and web deployment - not authenticated tenant behavior. The safe Paige context read remains PROOF_OWED; signed-in owner handoff and workspace-switch suppression remain unverified. All Google and later provider connections, reads, writes, receipts, reviews, listings, publishing, SEO/search claims, Rail outcomes, and Mind/Memory promotion remain UNAVAILABLE pending real provider contracts and tenant authorization.


### Solo Business Game Plan — owner-complete Tenant Brain vertical released (2026-09-06)

Owner direction supersedes the backend-first delivery framing without changing its history: the deployed Business Mission create/revise/transition, canonical readback and post-verification Rail foundation remains `LIVE`, but it is not an owner-complete product alone. The existing Command Center Business Game Plan is the only owner experience; there is no Mission sub-tab.

The released vertical preserves the existing `Set your plan` brief and replaces generic right-column Systems Check/dependency/automation/Work in Motion material with canonical Mission-backed `Plan in Motion` Strategic Plays. The owner can create, review, revise, approve, decline, pause, resume, complete and archive in one drawer. Cards show only canonical title, horizon, lifecycle stage, desired outcome, next meaningful step, owner and a blocker tied to that play. Owner actions and dedicated-Paige actions reuse the existing Mission RPCs and shared verified-mutation helper: the caller and active tenant resolve server-side, the canonical record is freshly re-read, and only a matching readback can produce Rail evidence or a success claim. Archive is a preserving transition, not deletion. The Paige handoff reuses the one workspace scope seam and sends only a tenant-stamped canonical Mission identifier and display label; the server refuses invalid or cross-workspace selection.

No strategy store, approval path, chat, Mind resolver or Memory write is added. The backend foundation remains `LIVE`; the released owner-complete Business Game Plan and overall Solo Tenant Brain remain `PARTIAL` pending authenticated owner/browser proof. Signed-in owner lifecycle actions, refusal, workspace switching, canonical Mission and matching Rail browser proof remain `PROOF OWED`. Mission Mind and durable Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`.

### Solo Business Game Plan — owner-complete candidate proof after current-main composition (2026-09-06)

The release candidate is rebased onto main 3eb3c9ae, preserves the Public Presence Paige lane, and leaves open PR #917's orchestration/import ownership intact. Post-compose proof passes 73 focused tests, all 265 repository test files / 3,832 tests, the TypeScript ratchet, production build, governance/security linters, and 198 real-component state/theme/viewport checks with no horizontal overflow. Those renders use fictional harness records and are not authenticated persistence evidence. The owner-complete Business Game Plan and Solo Tenant Brain remain PARTIAL; authenticated owner/refusal/workspace-switch/canonical Mission and Rail proof remain PROOF OWED; Mission Mind and durable Memory remain UNAVAILABLE.

At candidate time, PR #1038 was open as a draft and not yet merged or deployed. The production closeout below supersedes that release status while preserving the proof boundaries.

### Solo Business Game Plan — owner-complete production closeout (PR #1038)

PR #1038 rebased cleanly onto `49d25f4c`, passed all required gates at exact head `efad4044`, and squash-merged as `cc1e86f512dbaf795f26444b57fa8c8bcce56d63`. Production migration run 34078642940 applied and persisted `20260907001343`; Edge run 34078642934 deployed `business-mission-action` and `paige-ai-chat`; `db-live` and `edge-live` both point to `cc1e86f5`. Merge-time Security Audit 34078642936, UI evidence 34078642925, PAIGE Spine contract 34078642915, and CI 34078642951 passed. Both production version endpoints returned `cc1e86f512dbaf795f26444b57fa8c8bcce56d63-mtqnw05p`.

This is production release proof, not authenticated owner/browser proof. Business Game Plan remains `PARTIAL`; Mission/Rail remains `LIVE`; the Solo Tenant Brain remains `PARTIAL`; Mission Mind and durable Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`; authenticated owner, denied-role, workspace-switch, retry/failure, canonical Mission persistence and matching Rail browser proof remain `PROOF OWED`.


### Secure Browser security prerequisite — production closeout (2026-09-07)

PR #1042 passed exact-head CI, Security Audit, migration lint, PAIGE Spine contract, UI-delivery evidence, Vercel preview, an independent clean review, and a final added-line secret/sensitive-data scan at `2c83cfa37dd6554c597d440fe1984d3619eb9602`. It squash-merged as `ba3edd5386ba39a19f31a2c980f2245e6e4994a7`.

Production proof is bounded to the Paige-owned safety foundation. Migration run 34084460116 applied and persisted `20260907023754_secure_browser_session_tenant_scope.sql`; a separate count/structure-only production query confirmed non-null tenant attribution, forced RLS on the active and legacy-quarantine tables, no authenticated quarantine read, 0 active legacy rows, 2 preserved quarantined rows, and the `agency` / `platform_owner` provenance constraints. Edge run 34084460086 deployed `browser-use` and `skill-runner`. Fly run 34084460111 deployed `paige-browser` image `deployment-01M1X34VF9E8DFKSRVH6PM7R6X` (digest `sha256:343437e859025221232b1a41940816332eb72753e4436ed50d46c80b1a71c987`). Merge-time CI 34084460201, Security Audit 34084460211, UI evidence 34084460182, and PAIGE Spine contract 34084460128 passed. Both production version endpoints returned `ba3edd5386ba39a19f31a2c980f2245e6e4994a7-mtqrftk3`.

This does not release Secure Browser as a tenant capability. Browserbase remains `PROPOSED`, replaceable, unwired, and blocked by all seven vendor gates. No provider secret was used, no browser session or Context was created or persisted, no external login or Connected Account exists, and no credentialed execution was performed. The shipped foundation is tenant attribution, fail-closed authority, read-only egress enforcement, canonical grant reuse, and deployment evidence only. No customer-facing surface was bound, so the Surface Binding Ledger correctly gains no new Secure Browser surface entry.

### Solo Tenant Brain — Verified Campaign Brief with Paige MVP candidate (2026-09-07)

This bounded lane composes the existing dedicated Paige workspace and existing Campaigns Campaign Brief card with the existing `campaign.create` / `campaign.revise` / `campaign.list` Spine declarations, ordinary-action confirmation or valid standing authority, caller-scoped `configure_campaign_brief`, canonical `get_campaign_briefs`, the existing command receipt and workspace Rail.

The write response is not success: Paige re-resolves the tenant after mutation, fresh-reads the canonical projection, and compares exact brief id, returned version, lifecycle and intended fields before a success claim or Rail write. Duplicate-name ambiguity, denial, stale/foreign/missing records, authority/workspace change, unknown writes, failed reads and mismatches fail closed without successful Rail evidence.

This adds no Campaigns redesign, direct Campaign lifecycle operation, live-campaign roster, provider, Mission change, Mind projection or durable Memory. Rail copy is restricted to a verified Campaign Brief planning-record create/revision and cannot be read as launch, publish, spend, performance or completion.

Campaign Brief Mind and durable Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`; the Campaign Brief lane and Solo Tenant Brain remain `PARTIAL`; authenticated owner create/revise, return/reload card revision and matching Rail browser evidence remain `PROOF OWED`. Secure Browser/Browserbase status is unchanged.

Candidate verification: 38 focused and 161 adjacent regression assertions pass; the TypeScript ratchet and production build pass; required authority, registry, migration, release-governance, and sensitive-data checks pass; isolated PostgreSQL application/readback passes; independent review is CLEAN. The full repository run passed 3,898/3,900 under parallel load, with its two five-second repository-scan timeouts passing 21/21 immediately in isolation. PR #917 remains separately owned and stale against current main; this slice neither adopts nor resolves its pre-existing shared-file conflicts.

### Solo Tenant Brain — Verified Campaign Brief production closeout (PR #1047)

Supporting review-history head `8c9bf37ff617f70019ec6e3006f48e6d899d5172` passed required checks after two P2 review repairs and clean independent re-review, then squash-merged as the referenced production build `ae0a16a0d5147a4652a06925356c427c4d543d56`. Migration run 34150733491 persisted `20270105000000_campaign_brief_verified_rail_copy.sql`; Edge run 34150733561 deployed `paige-ai-chat`; merge-time CI 34150733476, PAIGE Spine 34150733506, Security Audit 34150733474 and UI evidence 34150733493 passed. `db-live` and `edge-live` both equal the merge SHA, and both production hosts return build `ae0a16a0d5147a4652a06925356c427c4d543d56-mtrk6vbx`. The verified-create/revise and post-readback Rail backend lane is `LIVE`; the owner-visible lane and Solo Tenant Brain remain `PARTIAL`; authenticated owner, denied-role, workspace-switch, canonical card revision and matching Rail browser evidence remain `PROOF OWED`; Campaign Brief Mind and durable Memory remain `UNAVAILABLE`; Secure Browser/Browserbase state is unchanged. Recovery is a fail-closed forward fix and `paige-ai-chat` redeploy; applied migrations and tenant records are never rewritten or deleted.

### Funding & Coaching Tools — provider package boundary + registry truth (owner ruling 2026-09-13)

Owner product-boundary ruling: ten finance/credit providers — SmartCredit, Plaid, Nav, Array, Secretary of State, OpenCorporates, SEC EDGAR, D&B, LexisNexis, TransUnion Business — are ONE optional Marketplace package, "Funding & Coaching Tools", NOT universal Solo capabilities and NEVER a platform default (§2/§9/§194). A tenant explicitly installs the package; install alone grants no provider connection, no financial-data access, no paid lookup, and no automatic external action. Financial connections (Plaid, Nav, Array, QuickBooks, SmartCredit where applicable) belong together under Settings → Integrations → Financial — per-tenant, encrypted, revocable, consent-bound, never cross-tenant; disconnecting a provider stops future provider calls without destroying historical tenant records.

Registry truth delivered (docs-only, branch `claude/paige-os-integration-82ywpq`, head `9a815df9`): SmartCredit, Nav.com business credit, and multi-source business-verification are now full Integration Capability Registry controlling entries (closing the delivery-rule debt that #1207/#1213/#1214 merged owing), each naming package membership, the entitlement requirement (reuse the existing `is_finance` marketplace gate → `funding_enabled`; never a new system), the per-tenant Financial connection/consent requirement, and honest status. Truth labels: the "Funding & Coaching Tools" package itself is `UNAVAILABLE` (not built — no marketplace `bundle` row seeded); SmartCredit + Nav are `PROOF OWED` (real paid-API reads, config-gated, dormant); business-verification is `PARTIAL` (OpenCorporates + SEC EDGAR direct, Secretary-of-State via Firecrawl, while D&B / LexisNexis / TransUnion Business / Array are inert adapter stubs).

Material known limitation (§13/§32.c): the provider edge functions (`smartcredit-pull-snapshot`, `nav-pull-profile`, `business-verifier`) fail closed today ONLY by dormancy — a global config/env gate + `can_access_contact`/RLS authority — and do NOT yet enforce the package entitlement or a per-tenant Financial connection/consent. That fail-closed entitlement+connection gate is OWED (item 2), to be built on the existing Marketplace `bundle`/`is_finance` entitlement + the `tenant_mcp_connections` encrypted-connection pattern, routed through the canonical Gateway (`decideGovernedExecution` capability-availability — which the ten functions do not currently traverse), and coordinated with the Marketplace catalog (#670) and the Financial-Integrations surface — never a parallel entitlement or connection registry, and never the legacy `subscription_plans.has_funding_tools` PlanGate. Do NOT claim "Funding & Coaching Tools is available" until the Marketplace entitlement, Financial connection states, and provider runtime paths are source-backed and proven. Paige gets the same package-aware capabilities only through Gateway → entitlement → connection/consent → authority/approval → provider action → readback → receipt/Rail; no direct provider shortcut.

**Ownership split + build GO (owner decision 2026-09-13).** Marketplace (#670) owns the Funding & Coaching Tools bundle/catalog entry, tenant install entitlement, package copy + Marketplace UI. Financial Integrations owns Settings → Integrations → Financial (connection cards, consent, lifecycle, health, disconnect/reconnect, provider-specific setup UX). **Harness owns the server-side enforcement** — Gateway truth, entitlement/connection/consent checks, provider-call refusal, audit/receipt path, registry truth, and tests; domain/provider adapters keep their own canonical provider logic; no parallel entitlement system, connection registry, or provider router. The Harness fail-closed gate is AUTHORIZED to build now (reusing the existing `is_finance`/`funding_enabled` marketplace entitlement seam + the encrypted `tenant_mcp_connections`-shape connection pattern) WITHOUT seeding a live entitlement or activating any provider: every provider refuses before provider contact unless the server confirms package-installed + required Financial connection/consent + tenant-scoped caller authority + Gateway/risk/approval/budget, else returns honest `setup_required`/`unavailable`. A mutable global config flag or a "dormant" producer is explicitly NOT an acceptable gate. Runtime-safe first; the Marketplace catalog + Financial connection UIs adopt the same canonical facts afterward and must not block the server refusal path. §58 flag: gating `business-verifier` makes its currently-reachable public sources (OpenCorporates/SEC EDGAR/SoS-via-Firecrawl) return `setup_required` until the package is installed — an owner-directed tightening, not a silent removal. No provider activates for any tenant until the complete entitlement + connection/consent + authority path is merged, deployed, and proven; the package stays `UNAVAILABLE` until the Marketplace bundle + Financial connection surfaces are merged + deployed.
