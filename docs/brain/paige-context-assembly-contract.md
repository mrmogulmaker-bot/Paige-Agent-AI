# Paige Context Assembly Contract — PROPOSAL (owner green-lit via Stage 1)

> **Status:** PROPOSAL. Documentation only. Extends the Paige Runtime Harness doctrine
> (`docs/PAIGE-MASTER-PROJECT-REFERENCE.md` §3, responsibility #1 "Context assembly") as
> the third Stage 1 contract, sibling to `paige-durable-job-contract.md` and
> `paige-receipt-rail-contract.md`. It owns no Brain/Spine/registry fact and creates no
> new source of truth.

## 1. Problem (grounded survey, 2026-09-10, `main` `6dcde4da`)

Master §3's inventory: context assembly "remains distributed." Grounded:

- **`paige-ai-chat/index.ts` is 13,374 lines** containing at least six independent,
  hand-rolled context builders wired inline: persona resolution
  (`get_paige_persona_context`), working-tenant resolution, scoped identity
  (`contextUserId = scopedClientId || user.id`), semantic tenant knowledge
  (`match_tenant_knowledge`), skill prompts (e.g. `FUNDING_SKILL_PROMPT`), and the
  transcript replay with its silent prior-turn drop (#93/#117).
- **`_shared/client-context.ts` (851 lines)** — `buildUserContext` builds the biggest
  block (profile, subscription, tasks, businesses, documents, credit-awareness) as
  formatted strings, funding-gated by parameter. It is unit-testable and service-built
  (good), but its failure mode is a swallowed `catch` → silently partial context, and it
  returns a string, so no caller can tell what was available, degraded, or stale.
- **Silent degradation is the norm:** persona resolution "defaults to neutral" on error;
  working-context tenant resolution "defaults to null" with a `console.warn`; user
  context catches to empty. The doctrine requires failing closed on unresolved identity
  or stale scope — today the model just receives less context and the owner is told
  nothing.
- **The model citizen already exists:** `_shared/paige-spine/resolveEvidence.ts` — typed
  `available | unavailable` results with named reasons (`capability_unavailable`,
  `resolver_unavailable`, `subject_required`, `scope_changed`), exact-key validation, and
  scope-change detection. Proof that the pattern fits this codebase.

## 2. The contract

**One ContextBundle per turn, many typed sources, zero silent degradation.**

1. **Identity once, scope-checked continuously.** Actor, tenant, workspace, role, and
   act-as state resolve ONCE at turn start into the bundle; every subsequent step
   re-validates against `scope_changed` (the `resolveEvidence.ts` precedent). Identity
   never re-derives mid-turn, never blends (a scoped-client turn keeps the client's
   context under the client's identity — the existing `contextUserId` fence stays).
2. **Sources are typed resolvers, not string builders.** Each source returns
   `{ status: "available" | "unavailable" | "degraded", reason?, data }`. String
   formatting happens LAST, from structured results, so callers can render, test, and
   audit what was included. `buildUserContext`'s string output becomes a projection of a
   typed resolver, not the source of truth.
3. **Degradation is recorded, never silent.** An unavailable source appears in the bundle
   with its reason and (per the receipt contract) can ride the turn's trace. The model
   may be told "X unavailable" in bounded language; the owner can see it on the Rail.
   What is NEVER allowed: catch-to-empty, default-to-neutral identity, null-tenant with
   a warn and onward execution as if scoped.
4. **Minimum necessary.** The bundle carries only sources the task's lane requires
   (funding gate precedent: credit context rides only when the tenant's funding preset
   is on). Breadth is a policy decision recorded in the bundle, not an accident of
   which builder ran.
5. **Eligibility rules hold.** Brain knowledge, bounded Mind evidence, and governed
   Memory enter only through their existing eligibility contracts; the bundle assembles,
   it never bypasses.

## 3. Adapter-first rollout

1. **Seam module** `_shared/paige-context/` — the `ContextSource` / `ContextBundle` types,
   the identity resolver, and the degradation ledger. No tables; dependency-free,
   vitest-importable (the `resolveEvidence.ts` and durable-job seam precedents).
2. **First adopter: `buildUserContext` → typed resolver.** Biggest block, already
   unit-testable with a mock client; its catch-to-empty becomes honest
   `degraded`/`unavailable` results, with the existing string projection preserved for
   the prompt so no model-behavior change ships in the same beat.
3. **Then:** persona + working-tenant resolution into the bundle (their silent defaults
   become recorded degradations); transcript replay's prior-turn drop becomes an
   explicit bounded-Mind source (joins the #93/#117 memory workstream, which owns the
   compaction design).
4. **New work rule:** any new context source ships as a typed resolver; no new inline
   string-builder in a function body.

**Maturity gate.** `PROOF OWED` until the first adopter proves: sources report honest
availability under mock failures, degradation is visible in the bundle (and testable),
identity fence holds under scoped-client turns, and no prompt output changes in the
refactor beat (byte-comparable projection for identical inputs).

## 4. Collision assessment

- Extends Master §3 responsibility #1; owns no Brain/Spine/Rail/registry fact.
- #917 (orchestration/tools): the bundle feeds the same governed execution path; no
  orchestration decision preempted.
- #576/#591 (chat/knowledge isolation): the identity-once fence composes with their
  account-switch fences; their acceptance criteria are untouched.
- #93/#117 (memory/compaction): the transcript source defers to that workstream's design;
  this contract only types the seam.
- #754 (Brain wiring): Brain/Mind/Memory eligibility contracts are linked, not redefined.
