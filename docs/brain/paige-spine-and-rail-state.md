# PAIGE Spine & Rail — verified current state

**Read this before claiming any department is "connected to PAIGE," before adding a Spine capability,
and before reading anything into an empty Solo activity feed.**

Grounded 2026-09-02 against `origin/main` `ed22066e71294099e48f0b52c742e3f379faf23c`, with the code
and schema claims established at `76bb3bbca` (#728) and re-checked unchanged at `05735f26b` and
`ed22066e7` — the commits between them are documentation only.

**Re-grounded 2026-09-02 at `1fb7928862b312245dc16927eb4a52c9463206ca`** after the Rail resolver
foundation merged and deployed (#785, then the #794 remediation in #795). The consumer-side claims
below were re-checked at that commit and are **unchanged** — which is the point of the new section
that follows: a safe server read now exists, and *nothing calls it yet*.

## The rule this file exists to enforce: existence ≠ reachability

Three different things get called "verified," and collapsing them is how this repository has twice
recorded something as working that a person could not use:

| Class | What it proves | What it does NOT prove |
|---|---|---|
| **Production catalog / schema** | an object is DEPLOYED — a function exists, a grant is present or absent, a migration is applied | that any code path calls it, or what it returns |
| **Automated test** | the assertions written down pass | that the assertions cover the failure |
| **Authenticated runtime** | a real person completed the flow on the real platform | — |

Everything below states which class it belongs to. **Nothing here was driven in a browser.**

## The Spine is PARTIAL — two capabilities, not a connected platform

**Do not read the Spine's existence as departments being wired to PAIGE.** Measured by running the
repo's own guards on 2026-09-02, with the capability count re-measured 2026-09-03:

| Measure | Value | How |
|---|---|---|
| Registered Spine capabilities | **2** | `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/ci/paige-spine-registry-lint.mjs` → `PASS (2 capability)` |
| Inline Chat tools | **105** | `node scripts/ci/chat-tool-registry-lint.mjs` → `105 tool(s) inline, none added (baseline 105)` |
| Classified actions | **62** — 32 `ordinary`, 28 `high`, 2 `owner_only`, 5 exempt, 0 unclassified writes | `npm run lint:action-risk` |

The first capability is `pipeline.deal_stage_evidence` — read-only, `chatBinding: PARTIAL`,
`mindBinding: PARTIAL` (raised from `UNAVAILABLE` by PR **#747** on 2026-09-02 — a `PARTIAL` binding,
not a `LIVE` one). **PAIGE reaches departments today
through the 105 hand-wired tools, not
through the Spine.** The Spine is the governed path with two capabilities crossed over.

The second is **`business_context.readiness`** (2026-09-03) — read-only status + provenance over four
Setup fields (`website`, `business_phone`, `industry`, `primary_business_email`), never a raw value.
Adapter `public.get_business_context_readiness(uuid)`. It is the **first WORKSPACE-level Spine
capability**, and it reached that without the shared-primitive change the section below says a
workspace-level capability needs — because **it does not use the Rail resolver at all.** Read the next
section with that distinction in mind: those four constraints govern *Rail-signal-backed* capabilities.
A capability whose evidence is a live read over a tenant's own current record has no signal to resolve,
no `contact_id` to be null, and no client-scoped Chat gate to sit behind — so it sidesteps all four.
That is not a loophole in the constraints; it is a different evidence class, and it buys none of the
Rail's properties (no history, no citation, no attribution, no freshness boundary — the row is simply
current as of the call). Its `chatBinding`/`mindBinding` are `PARTIAL`: `paige-ai-chat` injects the
block into every tenant turn's system context, unit-tested, with no authenticated UI drive yet.

The third is **`team.authority`** (2026-09-03, PR **#876**, migration `20261150000000`) — exactly two
Team-owned facts about the CALLER: `viewer_permission` (the raw `tenant_members.role`) and
`viewer_is_legal_owner` (`is_tenant_owner(caller, tenant)`, **both arguments**). Same evidence class as
`business_context.readiness`: a live stateless read, no Rail signal, `chatBinding`/`mindBinding`
`PARTIAL`.

**Why only two facts.** PAIGE already receives member_count and the invitation list from Team's own
hydration block, so projecting either again would be a second, separately-computed answer to a settled
question — and a WRONG one: `get_paige_team_context()`'s `invitation_count` has no status filter, so on
production tenant `d8a0a880` it reports 2 for a workspace whose two team tokens are one accepted and
one revoked. That is Team's to fix; this capability declines to shadow it.

**Why two facts and not one.** `get_paige_team_context()` computes permission as
`is_owner OR role = 'owner' -> 'owner'`, which is wider than the canonical ownership predicate — so a
single string would mean membership and ownership at once. Measured on production: all 13 active members
have the two agreeing (7 owner/is_owner=true, 6 admin/is_owner=false, zero divergent rows), so this
changes no answer today and stops a future divergence from becoming a wrong one.

**Billing-notice eligibility is deliberately NOT in it.** That is a Platform Billing fact about a team
member, and Billing publishes its own Spine read (`get_billing_spine_evidence`, live via
`20261140000000`). A capability drawing from `tenant_members` AND `platform_billing_contacts` would blur
the ownership line inside the registry entry itself.

### Both readiness reads name the workspace they resolved (2026-09-03, PR #876)

A cross-workspace defect found by an independent review, latent on production and structurally certain
to fire. `get_paige_persona_context()` resolves the conversation's tenant **client-link first**
(`clients.linked_user_id`), falling back to `current_user_tenant_id()`. So a user who is a linked CLIENT
of workspace B and a TEAM MEMBER of workspace A holds a conversation scoped to B while both readiness
reads resolve A — and both Chat call sites gated only on "the persona has SOME tenant".

The Team hydration path never had this hole, because `get_paige_team_context()` RETURNS its tenant and
`_shared/team-context.ts:71` refuses on mismatch. The two readiness reads did not, so **the binding was
impossible rather than omitted** — which is why a call-site guard alone could not have fixed it.

Both reads now return the workspace they resolved (`tenant_id` on every row, including refusals), and
both Chat adapters render nothing when it is not the conversation's. A genuine read FAILURE still
renders the honest "I can't check" block — the error paths return before the binding — so a failure and
a mis-scoped answer stay distinct. `get_business_context_readiness` needed a drop-and-recreate to add
the column; its body was reproduced byte-exactly from the deployed definition (md5
`676d4c4f7c2096fd866e264f836d1d4f`).

**Severity, measured before fixing:** production carries ZERO rows with `clients.linked_user_id` set, so
the client-link branch never fires and no user could trigger it. It stops being latent the moment a
client portal user is linked, which is the product's core purpose (§7).

**RELEASED AND PROVEN ON PRODUCTION 2026-09-03** — PR #864, merge commit `7ad98cff`, migration
`20261112000000`. This is the class of evidence the table at the top of this file calls
*production catalog / schema* PLUS a real execution, and it is worth being exact about which
claims it does and does not support:

| Claim | Evidence | Class |
|---|---|---|
| The migration persisted | `schema_migrations` row for `20261112000000` went **0 → 1**; the function object went **0 → 1**. Baseline captured on prod BEFORE the merge, so this proves the deploy acted rather than confirming what was already there | production catalog |
| The shipped gate is the tenant-scoped one | `pg_get_functiondef` on prod, comment lines stripped: executable code contains `is_tenant_admin` and does NOT contain `has_any_role`. The literal gate line is `and not (public.is_tenant_admin(v_tenant) or public.is_platform_owner())` | production catalog |
| The grant surface is right | on prod: `anon` cannot execute; `authenticated` and `service_role` can; `SECURITY DEFINER` with `search_path` pinned | production catalog |
| **The defect was real and is fixed** | tenant `d8a0a880` holds website, phone AND industry in `tenant_legal_profile` while `tenants.brand` held **none** of them — it was being told all three were missing. Executing the deployed function as that workspace's real owner returns `website: owner_confirmed`, `business_phone: owner_confirmed`, `industry: owner_confirmed` (source `setup`, with freshness), and `primary_business_email: connection_sourced` (source `connections`) | **authenticated runtime, server-side** |
| The role gate refuses a non-staff caller | **NOT provable on prod today** — there are currently **zero** active `tenant_members` whose role is not owner/admin, so no such caller exists to test with. Proven instead by the CI pgTAP file (18 assertions, mutation-tested: reverting to the global predicate turns 3 of them red). On production it is a forward-looking guard protecting the first member or client ever added | automated test |
| The consumer path is live | `deploy-edge-functions` shipped `paige-ai-chat`, `systems-check-run-change`, `systems-check-run-onboarding`, `systems-check-run-scheduled`; `edge-live..main` drift is zero | production catalog |
| The owner's own UI flow | **STILL OWED.** Not "no browser" — see the correction below | UNVERIFIED |

**§13 correction, recorded because the wrong reason was quoted repeatedly.** Through this slice I
claimed the live drive was owed because the session had *no browser capability*, and that production
was unreachable. Both were false, and `lessons-learned` **0h** is written about exactly this move.
`npm run harness:selftest` launches real Chromium via Playwright and passes every falsifiability arm;
`https://paigeagent.ai` returns 200 from the sandbox. The true limit is narrow and checkable:
**`LIVE_DRIVE_EMAIL` / `LIVE_DRIVE_PASSWORD` are unset**, so the *authenticated* UI drive cannot run.
Contract-level production verification needs no browser at all, which is why the table above exists.

**One consequence worth an owner decision, not a defect.** Setup is now the source, so two tenants
(`7eaf8859`, `e7f1b157`) whose values live only in the legacy `tenants.brand` — written by the older
`update_business_profile` path, never confirmed in Setup — now read `needs_confirmation` where the
old reader said "present". Neither has a published growth page, so `website_connected` flips
pass → fail for both, and `comms_configured`'s phone half flips for `7eaf8859`. That is literally
true ("the owner has not saved this in Setup") and is the direction the source-of-truth rule points,
but it IS a visible change for those workspaces (§58: flagged, not silent).

**No department other than Pipeline and Setup's business context is declared in the registry.** The
Team and Setup surface cards (`../doctrine/surface-cards/`) each say the same of themselves,
independently.

### Why most departments cannot simply be added

Four properties of the shipped code decide eligibility. They are constraints, not preferences:

1. **The Rail is per-client, at three independent layers** — `paige_client_events.contact_id` is
   `NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id)`; `record_rail_event` raises `contact not in tenant`; and the Chat
   emitter returns early at `if (!contactId) return`. A workspace-level outcome has nowhere to go.
2. **The resolver accepts `subject_type = "client"` and nothing else** (`resolveEvidence.ts`).
3. **Spine evidence loads only inside a client-scoped Chat turn** (`paige-ai-chat/index.ts`,
   `if (scopedClientId)`), so there is no Spine evidence in a general business question.
4. **The safe summary is a CONSTANT** — the adapter returns a fixed sentence plus enumerated scalars.
   A department whose value lives in free text cannot express it under this contract.

Consequence: **Team · Settings · Connections · Marketplace · Billing · Analytics · Social are
workspace-level and cannot reach `LIVE` AS RAIL-BACKED CAPABILITIES without a shared-primitive
change.** The owner ruled 2026-09-02 (Team card, decision 2) that a Rail event may not carry a null
`contact_id`; the repair is a distinct tenant/workspace-level outcome projection, and it is a
**Spine Change Request**, unstarted.

**Corrected 2026-09-03 (§13):** as written above, that consequence read as "no workspace-level
capability at all until the Rail is changed." `business_context.readiness` disproves the broader
reading — a workspace-level capability CAN be declared and consumed today when its evidence is a
**live read** rather than a Rail signal. What still stands, unchanged, is the narrower claim: a
workspace-level capability cannot carry Rail HISTORY (an attributable, cited, dated record of an
outcome that happened) until that Change Request lands. Choose the class deliberately: "what is true
right now" is a live read and available; "what happened, and who did it" is Rail-backed and blocked.

### The reference implementation any new capability must copy

`public.get_pipeline_spine_evidence(text,integer)` — `SECURITY DEFINER` with pinned `search_path`,
requires `auth.uid()`, resolves the tenant server-side via `current_user_tenant_id()` (the caller may
not pass one), gates on a staff role, addresses the subject by the public-safe `clients.account_number`
rather than an internal UUID, and returns a fixed 19-column contract with no title, summary, payload,
user id, deal id or stage text.

**Production-verified grants (catalog class):** `authenticated` may EXECUTE it; `anon` may not.

## A safe server-side Rail reader EXISTS and is deployed — and as of 2026-09-03 the four owner-facing consumers CALL it

> **SUPERSEDED HEADING, corrected 2026-09-03 (§58 — the dated finding below is kept, not deleted).**
> This section was written on 2026-09-02 under the heading *"and no consumer calls it"*, which was
> true then and is false now. **Slice B moved all four owner-facing Rail consumers onto the deployed
> resolvers**; everything the 2026-09-02 text says about the resolver itself still stands, and

**Deployed 2026-09-02. Read this next to the section below, never instead of it.** The two facts are
not in tension: the server can now answer safely, and (as of the date this paragraph was written) no
owner-facing screen asked it.

`public.get_solo_rail_activity(p_limit integer)` — `SECURITY DEFINER`, `stable`,
`set search_path to 'public'` — returns tenant-scoped Rail history **without granting the browser any
access to `paige_client_events`**. Production catalog class, read 2026-09-02 at project
`xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu`:

| Property | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Migrations applied | `20261042000000` (#785) and `20261043000000` (#795), both present in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` |
| Overloads | exactly **1** — no stale signature left behind |
| Signature | takes `p_limit` only; **no tenant parameter** — the workspace is server-resolved, never caller-supplied |
| Projection | 11 reviewed display fields (`id, event_kind, surface, actor_type, audience, visibility, from_department, to_department, title, summary, occurred_at`). **Omits** `tenant_id`, `payload`, `ref_table`, `ref_id`, `actor_user_id`, `contact_id`. It **does** return `e.id`, the event row's own UUID primary key — so "no internal identifiers" would be false; the accurate claim is that it exposes no tenant, client, actor or source-record identifier, and no producer payload |
| On refusal | **raises `42501 RAIL_FORBIDDEN`** — it does not `RETURN;` an empty set |
| EXECUTE | `authenticated` ✔ · `service_role` ✔ (inert — `auth.uid()` is NULL there, so it raises) · `anon` ✘ |
| `paige_client_events` SELECT | still **denied** to `authenticated` and `anon` |

**Two properties are load-bearing and must survive any future change.**

1. **It refuses rather than returning empty.** A reader that answers a denied caller with zero rows
   reproduces, one layer down, the exact lie this whole file exists to name. `42501` is the contract.
2. **The direct-table revoke is the containment, and it stays.** `pce_staff_read` — the RLS policy on
   `paige_client_events` — carries the same tenant-agnostic role flaw described in #794 below. It is
   harmless *only* because the table privilege refuses before RLS is ever consulted. **Re-granting
   browser SELECT would make that defective policy reachable.** Do not "fix" the Rail by adding a
   grant. The resolver is the path.

### #794 — the defect this foundation shipped with, and the lesson that outlives it

Slice A (#785) reproduced `pce_staff_read` faithfully, **and reproducing it was the defect.** The
function gated on two clauses that answer questions about *different* tenants:

```sql
row filter :  WHERE e.tenant_id = v_tenant,  v_tenant := public.current_user_tenant_id()
role gate  :  public.has_any_role(v_uid, ARRAY['admin','super_admin','coach'])
```

`current_user_tenant_id()` honours `profiles.active_tenant_id` for **any** active `tenant_members`
row, at **any** role — a plain `member` qualifies. `has_any_role()` reads `public.user_roles`, whose
columns are `(id, user_id, role, created_at)`: **no `tenant_id`.** It is a global question — §59's
global-role trap. So a global `coach`/`admin`/`super_admin` role earned in tenant A, held by someone
who is merely a member of tenant B, satisfied the gate **on the role from A** and returned all of
tenant B's Rail, including the `audience='owner'` / `visibility='owner_internal'` rows.

**Be precise about who those rows are actually for — an earlier draft of this section stated the
boundary wrongly, in a security postmortem, which is the worst place to state one wrongly.**
`owner_internal` does **not** mean "the tenant owner alone". The resolver filters on
`where e.tenant_id = v_tenant` and applies **no `audience` or `visibility` predicate**
(`20261043000000:79–98`), and `pce_staff_read` likewise admits admins and coaches. So these rows are
**withheld from clients and from plain members, and visible to authorized tenant staff** — `owner`,
`admin`, `coach`. That is the real boundary, and it is exactly why #794 mattered: the defect handed a
**plain member's seat** the staff view, not merely a non-owner's.

Remediated by `20261043000000` (#795): the role is read from an active `tenant_members` row for the
**same** `v_tenant` the rows come from, so the two clauses now agree about which workspace they mean.
Verified on production — the deployed body no longer contains `has_any_role`.

**Scope that claim to the READER it was written about. It is not a Rail-wide all-clear, and reading
it as one is how this record would start asserting something the platform has not earned.** Verified
against the deployed bodies on 2026-09-03:

| Rail function | Kind | Carries `has_any_role`? | Refuses explicitly? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_solo_rail_activity` | reader | no | yes — `42501`, since `20261042000000` |
| `get_client_rail` | reader | no — removed by `20261044000000` | yes — `42501` |
| `get_client_rail_for_chat` | reader | no — added correct in `20261044000000` | yes — `42501` |
| `get_platform_rail` | reader | **never did** — it gates on `is_platform_owner()` | yes — `42501`, since `20261049000000` |
| `record_rail_event` | **writer** | **YES, still** | yes, but see below |

So the accurate statement, and the one to quote instead of line 134 alone: **no Rail READER carries
`has_any_role`, and no Rail reader answers a denial with an empty set.** The WRITER is the exception
on the first count, and it is tracked as **#824** — parked, unassigned.

**`get_platform_rail` was a different defect from #794 and must not be filed under it.** It never had
the global-role trap; its gate was always correct and no unauthorized caller ever received a row from
it. What it did wrong was answer a denial with `RETURN;`, so a refused caller could not tell *"you may
not see this"* from *"the platform Rail is empty."* Repaired by `20261049000000` (#834), which changed
only the shape of the refusal — the authority stays `is_platform_owner()` (super_admin only, §53) and
was deliberately **not** widened to `is_platform_operator()`.

**The writer's severity is NOT the reader's, and copying it across would overstate #824.**
`record_rail_event` confines every write with `PERFORM 1 FROM public.clients c WHERE c.id =
p_contact_id AND c.tenant_id = v_tenant`, raising `contact not in tenant`, so the **cross-tenant**
version is blocked. What survives is the **member→staff escalation inside one workspace** — the same
shape as #794, on the write path, and an integrity/attribution exposure rather than a disclosure one.
Its sharpest form is `p_narrow_to_owner = true`, which yields `audience='owner'` /
`visibility='owner_internal'`: a plain member could file into the owner's private feed.

### The Rail PRODUCER inventory — every write call site, by execution context

Measured against `main`. **Corrected twice in review; the corrections are recorded because the
method that produced them is the thing worth remembering.**

**TypeScript producers — eight call sites, seven service-role:**

| # | Call site | Client | `auth.uid()` | Reaches the `has_any_role` branch? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `_shared/mcp-outcome.ts:842` | service role | NULL | no |
| 2 | `_shared/railAutomation.ts:103` | service role | NULL | no |
| 3 | `growth-process-submission:519` | service role | NULL | no |
| 4 | `handle-inbound-sms:434` | service role | NULL | no |
| 5 | `paige-mcp:5282` | service role | NULL | no |
| 6 | `send-message:1374` | service role | NULL | no |
| 7 | `paige-ai-chat:889` | **service role** (`supabase`, built with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` at `:587`) | NULL | **no** |
| 8 | **`paige-ai-chat:11267`** | **caller JWT** (`supabaseClient`, anon key + `Authorization` at `:575`) | **set** | **YES** |

**SQL producers — three live, and they were missing entirely from the first version of this table:**

| # | Producer | Kind | Actor filed | Reaches the gate? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `customer_respond_to_action` (`20260712240000:282`) | `SECURITY DEFINER` fn | `'client'` | **depends on the subject** — a client caller lands in the `ELSIF` branch; a staff caller is admitted by `has_any_role` |
| 10 | `emit_booking_rail` (`20260712260000:125`) | `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger on `internal_bookings` (`AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE`, every row) | `'client'` | **depends on the subject** — and staff booking on a client's behalf is an ordinary path, so this reaches the gate routinely |
| 11 | **`configure_tenant_pipeline` (`20260831224500:251`)** | `SECURITY DEFINER` fn | `'owner_staff'` / `'paige_agent'`, with `p_narrow_to_owner = true` | **YES, always** |

**`SECURITY DEFINER` does not null `auth.uid()`** — it changes the executing role, not the JWT claim —
so an authenticated caller reaching any of these carries their subject into `record_rail_event`.

### Which branch admits a write depends on the SUBJECT, not the actor_type filed

This is the correction that matters most, and it is not a detail: `record_rail_event` tests
`has_any_role(v_uid, …)` **first**, and only falls to the client branch when that fails. So the
declared `p_actor_type` does not decide which branch runs — **who is holding the session does.**

**Always gate-exercising:** `paige-ai-chat:11267` (mirrors every successful CRM or action tool result
as `owner_staff` through the caller's JWT) and `configure_tenant_pipeline` (files a deal move as
`owner_staff`/`paige_agent` with `p_narrow_to_owner = true`, the `owner_internal` shape).

**Conditionally gate-exercising, whenever a staff subject triggers them:** `emit_booking_rail` and
`customer_respond_to_action`.

**The booking trigger is the one that matters, and the path into it is specific.** It fires on
**every** insert or update of `internal_bookings`, but which writers carry a JWT subject decides
whether the gate runs:

**Do not try to enumerate the writers. The set is OPEN, and that is the finding.** Verified on
production: `authenticated` holds **INSERT and UPDATE directly on `internal_bookings`**
(`has_table_privilege` both true, 5 RLS policies), and **all four** booking RPCs are
authenticated-executable — `create_internal_booking`, `admin_set_booking_status`,
`cancel_internal_booking`, `reschedule_internal_booking`.

So any authenticated caller RLS permits — through an RPC, or by writing the table directly through
the Data API — fires this trigger with their own subject. There is no closed list of callers to
enumerate, and three successive attempts to write one here were each incomplete.

**The rule that replaces the list:**

> **Every authenticated *event-eligible* write to `internal_bookings` reaches the `has_any_role`
> gate.** Only service-role writers (`booking-manage`, `public-booking`, and the `service_role`-only
> `create_class_booking` / `reschedule_class_booking`) skip it, because `auth.uid()` is NULL there.

**"Event-eligible" is load-bearing, because the trigger returns early on most writes.** It files
nothing for a contactless or tenantless row, for an INSERT that is already `cancelled`, for an UPDATE
that neither cancels nor moves `start_at`, or for a non-representative collective-booking row
(`20260712260000_booking_rail_emit.sql:58-60, 68-90, 107-120`). A trigger proof using any of those
transitions **passes without ever reaching `record_rail_event`** — green, and vacuous.

**What that means for a #824 fix, and it is the load-bearing consequence:** the proof belongs at the
**trigger**, not at a list of call sites. A proof that walks named callers can always be defeated by
the caller nobody listed — including a direct table write that no TypeScript in this repository
performs today but the grant permits. Prove that `emit_booking_rail` still records under a staff
subject after the gate changes — using a transition that actually reaches the Rail call — and the
caller set stops mattering.

**And this path files a mismatched attribution, which is worth knowing before anyone "fixes" it.**
`v_actor := CASE WHEN p_actor_type IN ('owner_staff','client') THEN v_uid ELSE NULL END`, and the
trigger files `p_actor_type = 'client'`. So a staff-triggered booking writes a row that *declares* a
client action while recording the **staff** UID as `actor_user_id`. That is pre-existing behaviour,
not something #824's fix introduces — but it means the row's actor field and its actor_type already
disagree on this path, and a fix should not be blamed for it or accidentally "correct" it without a
separate decision.

`customer_respond_to_action` is a customer action by design, so a staff subject there is unusual but
not structurally prevented.

**#824's severity is still unchanged** — member→staff inside one workspace, integrity rather than
disclosure, escalation population zero. What changed is the fix-impact surface: a two-direction proof
is owed at **two paths always and two more conditionally** — not at the Chat site alone. Tightening
the gate touches live write paths in three different languages of caller (edge TypeScript, a SQL
function, a table trigger), and breaking any of them stops the Rail recording silently.

### The method error, recorded because it repeated

The first version of this table said "all eight" and named one gate-exercising site. It was wrong
twice: `paige-ai-chat:889` was called caller-JWT when it is service-role (the two clients differ by
one identifier twelve lines apart at `:575`/`:587`), and the SQL producers were absent because the
inventory grep was scoped to `supabase/functions/**` and `src/**` — **migrations were excluded, so a
producer written in SQL could not appear.**

That is the **third** narrow-scope search error in this line of work: `src/`-only missed Chat's
resolver consumer (#836), and this one missed an entire producer language. The rule that would have
caught all three: **when a claim is about "everywhere", the search must be repository-wide first and
narrowed only to explain results — never scoped first and generalised after.**

**Measured exposure, stated honestly:** 3 users hold a global staff role across multiple tenants;
**0** currently sit at a non-staff seat. Structurally live, never reached. **Re-measured 2026-09-03
for the writer's population** — 9 users hold a global staff role *at all*, and **0** of them sit at a
non-staff seat in any workspace, so the escalation population is empty on both paths. The 9 and the 3
answer different questions (held-at-all vs. held-across-multiple-tenants) and are not in conflict; the
figure that governs is the zero, which agrees. That was not a reason to
downgrade the repair — the path opens the moment any global-role holder is invited as a plain member
elsewhere, which is ordinary.

**Three lessons, recorded here because `docs/brain/lessons-learned.md` has three open PRs contending
for its tail (#729, #731, #754 all append at 1276–1279) and a fourth append would conflict with all
of them.** They belong in that file when the contention clears.

1. **Fidelity to a defective policy resurrects the defect.** Slice A's tests asserted the function
   *matched* `pce_staff_read`. Matching it was the bug, so those assertions could not see it. A test
   that encodes "behaves like the thing we are replacing" is not a safety net.
2. **A revoked grant can be the only thing containing a flaw — so re-exposing the semantics through a
   different object type re-opens it.** The policy was unreachable; an EXECUTE-granted `SECURITY
   DEFINER` function with the same body is very reachable. Object type changed, guard did not.
3. **The review-timing gap is preserved as fact, not tidied away.** Slice A merged ~12 seconds after a
   Codex review began; that review never completed before production deployment, and this remediation
   is the direct consequence. #795 did receive a completed Codex review on its exact final head. Every
   Rail PR now requires one before Gate B. **Do not rewrite the #785 history as though it had one.**

## Owner-visible Solo Rail activity is UNAVAILABLE — not empty, not healthy

**This is the single most consequential current-state fact in this file, and it must not be read as
"there is no activity."**

`src/solo/data/useSoloActivityFeed.ts` reads `paige_client_events` directly over PostgREST as
`authenticated`, relying on the RLS policy `pce_staff_read`.

**Production says `authenticated` has NO SELECT privilege on that table** (catalog class, verified
2026-09-02). The grant was revoked by `20260712200000_paige_context_rail_step2_realtime.sql:25` and
never re-granted — four grant/revoke statements exist across 910 migrations and the revoke sorts last.
**RLS never gets consulted; the table grant is checked first.**

**Truthful status — use this wording, not a paraphrase:**

> `UNAVAILABLE — production Rail history cannot be read, and the current owner-facing consumer
> treatment is not reliable enough to distinguish denied history from empty history.`

**Do not call this healthy, empty, honest, repaired, or production-executable.**

**CORRECTED 2026-09-02 (§13 — this file's first version overstated the failure mode).** It said the
hook "honestly renders an error rather than an empty feed" and called this "a dead capability, not a
lying one." That generalised from ONE hook's internal branch to the platform's behaviour, and the
consumers were never checked. Issue **#746** established the rest, and it was re-verified here rather
than relayed:

| Path | Consumer | Distinguishes denied from empty? |
|---|---|---|
| `useRailEvents` (Context Rail) | `src/components/paige/PaigeRailFeed.tsx:108` · `src/components/app/ClientActivityFeed.tsx:144` — both destructure only `{ events, connected }` | **NO.** `grep` for `historyError\|historyLoaded` outside the hook and its tests returns **no matches**, so a refused read renders exactly like an empty feed |
| `useSoloActivityFeed` (Solo Trust Compass **and** Team activity) | **Both** consumers distinguish. `src/solo/compass.tsx:377` and `src/solo/team.tsx:235` each compute `loading ? … : error ? 'error' : …` and render `role="alert"` — *"Recent activity could not be loaded, so this is not a record of nothing happening"* and *"This timeline could not be loaded, so it is not a record of nothing happening"*. **Retry is a separate question and is not universal** — see the measured exception below | **Yes for failure visibility; partly for recovery.** **Corrected 2026-09-02, twice:** an earlier version named only `compass.tsx` (`team.tsx` had the same treatment and was uncredited), and the row then claimed both render "with a retry", which is false for Compass at ≤1020px |

So the platform-level statement is *not reliable enough*: **two shipped consumers cannot distinguish
and two can.** (**Corrected 2026-09-02** — this sentence read "two cannot distinguish, one can" while
the row above it already named both `compass.tsx` and `team.tsx`; the count was left behind when Team
gained the treatment.) **An operator who opens the Command Center a minute after PAIGE acts can be told
she has done nothing** (#746) — through `PaigeRailFeed` or `ClientActivityFeed`, which are the two that
collapse it. That is the failure mode — not a visible error.

Two things follow:

- **Leg 7 of the platform goal chain — *owner can see the result* — is broken for every department
  that emits to the Rail**, not only for the ones that emit nothing.
- `paige_audit_log`, the other durable attribution store, **has no Solo reader at all**. Both paths to
  "what did PAIGE just do" are closed.

**Never record this as an empty feed or a healthy one.** If a future session sees no activity in Solo,
the first hypothesis is this grant, not an idle workspace.

### THE TENANT-WIDE RAIL WAS DARK FOR EVERY SOLO TENANT — measured and repaired 2026-09-03

**The finding.** Slice B repaired all four owner-facing Rail consumers, and two of them were still
unreachable by a Solo tenant. `PaigeRailFeed` ("Across your clients — live") ships inside
`PaigeWorkspace`, which `TenantCommandCenterShell` renders **only when the Solo workspace is
absent** (`TenantCommandCenterShell.tsx:606`) — and the Solo shell always supplies it
(`SoloApp.tsx:272`). Confirmed by search: **no `PaigeRailFeed` or `PaigeSidebar` reference exists
anywhere under `src/solo/` or `src/components/tenant-shell/`**, and the mobile `PaigeRailSheet` is
mounted inside the same `PaigeWorkspace` (`PaigeWorkspace.tsx:283`). So the tenant-wide strip is an
Agency / sub-account / admin-shell surface, and a Solo tenant had **no** surface showing the
tenant-wide rail at all.

> **§13 CORRECTION, 2026-09-03, same day — the claim above is WRONG and is kept, marked, rather
> than rewritten (§58).** "A Solo tenant had no tenant-wide rail surface at all" is false, and it

**Why this was invisible until now.** Slice B's proof was automated, static and deployed-bundle —
all of which pass for a component that renders correctly on a surface nobody can reach. It surfaced
only when the owner test map was written against the *actual* account topology rather than against
the component list. **A repaired consumer on an unreachable surface is not a repaired capability.**

**The repair (this slice).** A compact `Recent activity` panel in the Solo Command Center's Systems
Check side stack (`SoloSystemsCheckWorkspace.tsx`), reading the SAME already-deployed
`useSoloActivityFeed` → `get_solo_rail_activity` the Trust Compass and Team Activity panels use.
**Not a second Rail source**: `useSoloActivityFeed.ts` is byte-unchanged by this slice, and no event
is duplicated or re-derived. No CSS was added — the panel reuses the surface's own `sc-side-panel` /
`sc-section-heading` / `sc-approval` / `sc-muted` / `sc-proof` vocabulary.

**Safe fields hold by CONSTRUCTION, not by filtering at the surface.** `get_solo_rail_activity`
returns eleven display columns; `toActivityItem` narrows those to
`{id,title,summary,byPaige,departmentSlug,occurredAt}`. There is no `payload`, `ref_table`,
`ref_id`, `actor_user_id`, `tenant_id` or `contact_id` in the shape at all, so none can reach the
markup. `id` is a React key and is never rendered, and the feed's `error` string is deliberately
NOT rendered — `status` alone drives the copy — so no SQLSTATE, server text or function name can
surface on a tenant screen. Both properties are asserted, and both assertions were falsified.

**Workspace switch has TWO layers, and the first one already existed.** `CommandHub` keys the mount
on `activeTenantId` (`CommandCenter.tsx:104`), so a switch **unmounts and remounts** the subtree —
no row, filter, pending read or loading state can survive it. The panel additionally forwards
`workspaceId` into the feed's render-time guard and request counter. The remount is the primary
mechanism; the guard is the second layer, and saying it the other way round would overstate what
the new code does.

**METHOD, carried forward from Slice B.** Every mechanism was deliberately falsified before the
slice was called done: the five states collapsed to `items.length` (5 failures), the row's UUID
rendered (1), the raw server error printed (1), the workspace reset moved from render into an
effect (1), the request-sequence guard removed (1). An `act()`-based assertion structurally cannot
observe a painted stale frame — the switch test records every committed frame from a
`useLayoutEffect` instead.

### CORRECTED 2026-09-03 — the four owner-facing consumers now call the resolvers (Slice B)

**What changed, and the one measurement that makes it matter.** `authenticated` has **no `SELECT`
privilege on `paige_client_events`** — re-verified on production `xygzykjyynhzqytbqnzu` on
2026-09-03: `has_table_privilege('authenticated','public.paige_client_events','SELECT')` = `false`.
So every direct-table read in `useRailEvents.ts` and `useSoloActivityFeed.ts` was **refused in
production, always, for every owner**. The two `useRailEvents` consumers then rendered that refusal
as *"Nothing across your clients yet"* and *"Nothing yet"*. **The Rail feeds were not sparse; they
were denied, and they said the opposite.**

Slice B changes the seam, not the schema — no migration, and no grant was widened:

| Consumer | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `src/hooks/useRailEvents.ts` (tenant scope) | `.from("paige_client_events").eq("tenant_id", …)` | `rpc("get_solo_rail_activity", { p_limit })` — **no tenant argument exists to pass** |
| `src/hooks/useRailEvents.ts` (client scope) | `.from("paige_client_events").eq("contact_id", …)` | `rpc("get_client_rail", { p_contact_id, p_limit, p_lens: "client" })` — the narrower lens |
| `src/solo/data/useSoloActivityFeed.ts` | `.from("paige_client_events")` | `rpc("get_solo_rail_activity", { p_limit })` |
| `src/components/paige/PaigeRailFeed.tsx` · `src/components/app/ClientActivityFeed.tsx` | destructured `{ events, connected }`, discarding the error | consume `historyStatus` — four states, kept apart |

Verified on production the same day: both resolvers are `EXECUTE`-granted to `authenticated` and
**not** to `anon` (`get_solo_rail_activity(integer)`, `get_client_rail(uuid,integer,text)`).

**This is a §9 TIGHTENING, and naming the mechanism matters more than the fact.** The direct read
was governed by `pce_staff_read`:

```
is_platform_owner() OR (tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()
                        AND has_any_role(auth.uid(), ARRAY['admin','super_admin','coach']))
```

That is the **§59 global-role trap**: `user_roles` carries no `tenant_id`, so `has_any_role` asks a
*global* question, while `current_user_tenant_id()` honours `active_tenant_id` for an active
`tenant_members` row at **any** role — plain `member` included. A user who is a plain member of
workspace B and holds a global `coach`/`admin` role earned in workspace A could therefore read
**B's entire tenant Rail** by switching workspace. `get_solo_rail_activity` closes that: it requires
an active `tenant_members` row **of the resolved workspace** at `owner`/`admin`/`coach`.

**§58 — the capability delta, stated rather than buried.** The only access removed is that
escalation path, which is the defect. No legitimate owner loses anything: the table read was
returning nothing to everyone. **`pce_staff_read` itself is UNCHANGED and still carries the trap** —
it is simply unreachable from these four consumers now. Any *other* direct reader still goes through
it; the two Analytics readers (`useClientEngagement.ts`, `CohortRetentionTable.tsx`) are exactly
that, and remain tracked as **#802**, routed to Analytics. Fixing the policy is not this slice's,
and the four consumers no longer depend on it either way.

**Removed export (§58, deliberate):** `railHistoryFilter` — it chose *which column* to filter, a
decision the server now owns outright. Its unit tests were replaced, not deleted, by tests of
`railHistoryRequest` (which resolver answers which scope) and `classifyRailReadError` (42501 is a
refusal, anything else is an outage). No user-facing capability rode on it.

**Request safety (the §51 shape this also closes).** A slow answer for one workspace could
previously land after a switch and paint under the next workspace's heading — both reads
individually authorized, so no policy could catch it. Both hooks now carry a monotonic request
counter, bumped **during render** on a scope change and again per read; a response is honoured only
while the counter still matches.

**METHOD NOTE, recorded because it nearly shipped as a false green.** The first version of the
switch tests asserted the DOM *after* `act()`, which flushes passive effects — so a reset moved from
render into a `useEffect` still passed 11/11. That test could not fail on the defect it named. The
tests now record every committed frame from a `useLayoutEffect` (which runs after the commit's DOM
mutations and before passive effects) and assert the previous scope appears in **none** of them.
Each mechanism was then falsified deliberately — guard removed, guard moved into an effect, the four
states collapsed back to `events.length === 0` — and each falsification produced the expected
failure. **An `act()`-based assertion structurally cannot observe a painted stale frame; if a future
session writes one, it is testing nothing.**

**Still owed (§13):** authenticated owner runtime proof. Everything above is automated, static and
production-catalog evidence. No browser drove the deployed surface as a signed-in owner in this
session.

**This verdict SURVIVED the resolver shipping, and the reason matters (2026-09-02).** A safe server
reader is now deployed — see the section above — but `useRailEvents.ts:198` and
`useSoloActivityFeed.ts:171` still read `paige_client_events` **directly**, and the browser still has
no SELECT on it. Re-measured on production at `1fb79288`, after both migrations:
`has_table_privilege('authenticated','public.paige_client_events','SELECT')` is **still `false`** — by
design, since that revoke is what keeps the defective `pce_staff_read` policy unreachable. So the
owner-facing behaviour is **byte-for-byte what it was**, and that means exactly what the consumer
matrix above says — no more:

- **The two `useRailEvents` consumers still collapse a refusal into an empty feed.** `PaigeRailFeed.tsx`
  and `ClientActivityFeed.tsx` destructure only `{ events, connected }`, so a denied read still renders
  as "nothing yet". **This is the remaining failure mode among the four Rail-feed consumers** — and it
  is deliberately scoped to those four, because they are the ones this record audits. **Two Analytics
  surfaces do the same thing to the same denied table** and are tracked separately as **#802**:
  `useClientEngagement.ts:48` and `CohortRetentionTable.tsx:74` each destructure only `{ data }`,
  discard the error, and fall through to `[]` — so a refusal is rendered as *"Insufficient data"* or
  as retention that never accumulated. **They are out of Slice B's scope, not out of the problem.**
- **The two `useSoloActivityFeed` consumers do NOT.** Both `compass.tsx:377` and `team.tsx:235` compute
  `activity.loading ? 'loading' : activity.error ? 'error' : …` and render an explicit `role="alert"`
  message — *"Recent activity could not be loaded, so this is not a record of nothing happening"* and
  *"This timeline could not be loaded, so it is not a record of nothing happening"*. **Do not describe
  these as showing "nothing yet".** They are the model treatment Slice B extends rather than replaces.
  - **Retry is NOT universal, and the exception is measured.** `team.tsx` offers *Try again* in every
    layout, and `compass.tsx` offers it in the wide layout (`compass.tsx:421`). But
    `solo-tokens.css:173` — `@media(max-width:1020px){ .paige-solo .tc-rail{display:none};
    .paige-solo .tc-railbtn{display:flex} }` — hides the branch that holds Compass's retry at
    **≤1020px**, and the foldout branch that replaces it (`compass.tsx:440`) carries `role="alert"`
    **with no retry control**. So at narrow widths a Compass user is told the read failed and has no
    **manual** way to re-attempt it.
  - **Recovery is NOT absent, though — and this correction matters more than the gap.**
    `useSoloActivityFeed.ts:193–198` re-reads on a `setInterval` of `POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 15_000` while
    the tab is visible, **and** on every `window` `focus` event. So an error state clears itself
    within ~15 seconds of the cause going away, in every layout, with no user action. The accurate
    statement is **"no visible manual retry control at ≤1020px"**, not "no retry" and not "no
    recovery" — those would be false.
  - **That gap is a Slice B input, not a documentation problem.** Slice B's state contract explicitly
    includes *failed with a truthful retry path*, so the compact Compass branch is inside its scope
    and must not be lost. §00: whether a recovery control **exists** is correctness and therefore
    ours; what it should **look like** is Claude Design's.

That split is why the platform status is *not reliable enough* rather than *never* — and why the
verdict is about the platform, not about every consumer equally.

The status line is therefore unchanged, and the honest shape of the remaining gap has changed:

> **Before:** no safe path existed.
> **Then (2026-09-02):** a safe path exists and no owner-facing consumer uses it.
> **Now (2026-09-03, Slice B):** all four owner-facing consumers use it, and each distinguishes
> loading, refusal, unavailable, empty and populated. What remains owed is authenticated owner
> runtime proof — not a code path.

Do not read "the resolver is deployed" as "the Rail is readable by the owner." Those are the two
classes this file's opening table exists to keep apart — **production catalog** proves the object is
deployed; it proves nothing about whether any code path calls it.

**Rail Recovery is tracked as issue #746 (RELEASE-BLOCKING), and #729 is BLOCKED from Gate 2 by it.**
#746 is the required separate Rail Recovery prerequisite for #729's first owner flow to become
production-executable. It is not assigned to #729, and not to this documentation record. **The
resolver landing did not lift that block** — #729's repair #1 operates on the direct-table read, which
is still refused. What changed is that the unblock is now a consumer change rather than a missing
capability.

**Existing work, not authorized as a release path:** PR **#644** (`codex/mind-safe-rail-contract`) adds
`public.get_solo_mind_rail_events()`, a guarded `SECURITY DEFINER` resolver over the same table that
returns structural fields and no producer content, and which *re-asserts* the browser revoke. It
exists because the direct read does not work. The owner ruled 2026-09-02 that it must be freshly
grounded on current `main`, checked against the canonical Spine contract, reviewed for
internal-identifier exposure (it returns `contact_id`, where the Spine lens deliberately uses the
public-safe `account_number`), and proven mergeable **before** it becomes a recovery recommendation.
Two review notes recorded so they are not re-derived: it resolves the workspace from
`profiles.active_tenant_id` **raw** rather than coalescing through `current_user_tenant_id()` — the
pattern behind the §51 #588 anchoring bug and the known Team invitation defect — though it does
correctly key on `profiles.user_id`. #746 adds a third: #644's resolver returns eight structural
fields and **no `title`/`summary`**, which the rail renders — so it is not a drop-in, and the
grant-versus-RPC seam decision must be made *with* #644 rather than around it.

## Pipeline governance — three findings, recorded as follow-up, NOT as capability

**Tracked as issue #755** (grouped, owner priority 3 — required before any Chat Pipeline write bridge).
The issue carries the owner decision, dependencies and sequencing; this file records only the state.
Governed follow-up work, not shipped behaviour:

1. **The Spine's Pipeline evidence is a silent subset.** It reads only Rail rows written by
   `configure_tenant_pipeline` with `policy_result='allowed'`. `deal_move_stage` (PAIGE's own Chat
   tool) writes `public.deals` directly with the service-role client and emits **no** Rail event;
   `pipeline_attach` in `growth-process-submission` does the same. **PAIGE can move a deal and not see
   her own move in her own evidence.**
2. **`deal_move_stage` never consults `move_policy`**, so an approval-required stage stops the board
   and `pipeline_configure`, and does not stop PAIGE's tool.
3. **`pipeline_move_approvals` is write-only.** The table appears in exactly one file — the migration
   that creates and inserts into it. Its `status` enum permits `approved|rejected|cancelled` and a
   `resolved_at` column exists; **no code path anywhere sets them.** A held request is unresolvable,
   and each one permanently increments the dependency count blocking archive of that stage or pipeline.

## What decides whether PAIGE may act (Trust Compass precision)

**The authoritative statement, and it does not change with the catalog finding above:**

> The server action-risk policy plus the canonical confirmation/approval gate decide whether PAIGE
> may act. The Solo Compass dial remains a non-authoritative UI control. Runtime reachability of the
> deployed Trust functions remains `UNVERIFIED`.

The production catalog proves only that `trust_effective_rung()` and `resolve_tool_autonomy(uuid,text)`
**exist**. It does **not** prove — and nothing here should be read to imply — that the Solo browser
Compass dial is authoritative, that the Compass currently governs action execution, that runtime calls
into those functions occur, or that effective autonomy enforcement is proven. `20261019001000:41-48`
separately records that the compass clamps **at render only**.

## The owner-approved priority order (2026-09-02)

Later items do not start ahead of earlier ones. Implementation is assigned by the owner, never
inferred from this file.

**Updated 2026-09-02** after the Rail resolver foundation merged and deployed. Prior states are
corrected in place rather than deleted; what each row *was* is recoverable from this file's history.
The Attention Register standard (`docs/doctrine/paige-attention-register.md` §8) names this exact
table as a live list that obliges an edit when #746 or #755 resolves — that is a known, accepted
overlap, not an oversight, and it is why the register exists.

| # | Work | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PR **#729** — cross-account Rail/Compass hotfix on #728 | **still BLOCKED from Gate 2 by #746.** Its repair #1 reads the direct table, which remains refused. Its `useRailEvents` scope guard is a real dependency for Rail Slice B, not an inconvenience |
| 2 | **Rail recovery + owner-visible outcome reading** — issue **#746**, RELEASE-BLOCKING | **OPEN — foundation only.** The safe resolver is deployed (#785 + the #794 remediation in #795); **no consumer has been moved onto it**, so no owner-facing screen is repaired. Closing #746 additionally requires authenticated owner runtime proof |
| 3 | **Pipeline governance repair** — issue **#755** — before any Pipeline Chat write bridge | parked, owner decision required |
| 4 | Stale doctrine correction | done for the Trust Compass claims (PR #743) |
| 5 | Calendar as the next bounded read-only Spine capability | not started, not authorized |

**Two open PRs already hold Rail consumer work and must not be duplicated (measured 2026-09-02).**
PR **#776** (`318f1dbd`) carries the now-merged `20261042000000` migration **plus** consumer changes to
`ClientActivityFeed.tsx`, `PaigeRailFeed.tsx`, `useRailEvents.ts` and `useSoloActivityFeed.ts` — that
is Slice B's surface. PR **#729** (`5fd08d2c`) owns the `useRailEvents.ts` scope guard covering a
painted-frame leak that a request-token approach alone does not catch: React commits a frame of the
previous scope's data before any passive effect can clear it. **Slice B adopts both rather than
rewriting them.** Neither may be merged except under its own owner's exact-head authority.

**#746 is not assigned to #729, and not to this record.** It is a separate Rail Recovery workstream.

**This file is a state record, not a backlog.** Every distinct finding lives as a linked GitHub issue
— #739, #740, #741, #742, #746, #755 — and is added to the PAIGE Attention Register when that project
becomes available. Do not grow a parallel list here.
